My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/67336824">2 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>Initially I bought this book thinking it would be a good primer on USA history.</p>
<p>Over the years it sat on my bookshelf I realized I should not expect that as I learn of <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1899.Howard_Zinn" title="Howard Zinn">Howard Zinn</a>, hear him on NPR a few times etc.</p>
<p>So, what do we end up with?</p>
<p>A long history of the USA from the &#8220;losers&#8221; (aka &#8220;people&#8217;s&#8221;) side. This is how Zinn portrays it.  There are few victories, no joyous moments and only endless oppression and cruelty.  And a repeated contrast on how history is written and how it was received by some segments.  For readers who need this wake-up call, this is well done (and I&#8217;ve chatted to one person who was in University where this book made them realize that history was &#8220;written by the winners&#8221; as the cliche goes), for others it gets&#8230;. depressing.</p>
<p>Especially without a lifetime of alternative/standard US history indoctrination this comes across strong, often without the needed context.  And it&#8217;s neither truly impartial or biased in as much as it&#8217;s clear there is an agenda here but it&#8217;s not clear what the agenda is other than showing the &#8216;other side&#8217;.  No solution is offered for a better way, no new doctrine or different &#8216;historical winner&#8217; is forthcoming, its lose, lose, lose for the People&#8217;s History.</p>
<p>All I can say is that I&#8217;m glad I read it in the summer when the skies are blue, but I was glad to lay it down and move onto other things (the etext of <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/73149.Scott_Lynch" title="Scott Lynch">Scott Lynch</a>&#8216;s <em>Queen of the Iron Sands</em> and then <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/search/search?q=James Feurst" title="James Feurst">James Feurst</a>: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5806175.Huge_A_Novel" title="Huge  A Novel by James Fuerst">Huge: A Novel</a> with <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2833413.Iain_Banks" title="Iain Banks">Iain Banks</a> <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6436659.Transition" title="Transition by Iain M.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I make no secret I&#8217;m a big, big, <b>Lord of the Rings</b> fan.  And I mean <b>the book</b>.  The movies are good, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but they are only a visualization of the original story.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve always considered it one book, as I first read all 1077 pages (*) of it in a nice fat omnibus trilogy paperback somewhere near the age of thirteen, often at night, in bed, with the night light on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve re-read it since, somewhere near every three-five years or so in various guises, although the advent of the movies, me owning both DVD movie versions of same, and well <i>time</i> has put a dint on that tradition.  The last time I read it all was traveling the world when I took Martin&#8217;s newer-edition trilogy paperback from Ireland, through Asia and finally sold it in a second hand book shop in Manly (Australia); much to my friend Andy&#8217;s disgust, as he would rather have liked to read it again himself.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s interesting (and a lot of internet blog reading time) to find on the <a href="http://tor.com">tor.com</a> website author <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&#038;search-alias=stripbooks&#038;field-keywords=kate nepveu&#038;tag=ballardcorner-20">Kate Nepveu</a> <a href="http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&#038;view=blog&#038;id=13692">reading and dissecting it a chapter at a time</a>.  And the first thing that strikes me (dropping in tonight right on Moria/Balrog/&#8221;You cannot pass&#8221; etc) just how good a writer Tolkien maybe was.  After all this time, the stereotype story of high-fantasy is because of good writing, and not just a good, awe-inspiring, culturally relevant (or not), aspersion to WWII  story?   In reflection, I&#8217;d like to think it was both.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I like the way this description uses contrasts with nature for emphasis:</p>
<p>    <i>Nothing happened. The cliff towered into the night, the countless stars kindled, the wind blew cold, and the doors stood fast.</i></p>
<p>It makes them feel so very immovable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(*) My memory may be off a little here, but it&#8217;s a possibly incorrect fact I want to live with &#8211; 1077 pages.  I&#8217;m pretty sure it is the length of the main story, not the appendix fluff at the end of the ROTK.  It was a black paperback with a red lava/Mordor image on the cover.  The omnibus that went from Ireland to Australia was in keeping with the artwork from the mid-Nineties (lighter, pastel-ish, in the same vien as  my own boxed-set trilogy sitting in the bookshelf in Ballard just now).  All the current paperback covers are tending to use images of the movie now &#8211; despite the fact that just about movie time there was some great new artwork done for many of the books.  Looking at Amazon for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lord-Rings-J-R-R-Tolkien/dp/0618260250/?tag=ballardcorner-20">current version of the omnibus</a> I see a nice picture of Gandalf from the movie and a page count of 1216 &#8211; it could easily just be 1077 pages to the end of the <i>real</i> story.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve skirted around ebook readers for a while especially the <a href="www.amazon.com/E-reader-Portable-Silver-E-book-Approx/dp/B000WPXQ2M?tag=ballardcorner-20">Sony eReader</a>, and ironically enough, just succumbed as my old Amazon colleagues finally released the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-com-kindle/dp/B000FI73MA?tag=ballardcorner-20">Kindle</a>.   A very different device &#8211; not so much a static reading device as a wirelessly-tethered access-point for Amazon sold books and content.</p>
<p>Along with the fact it&#8217;s butt-ugly compared to the Sony gorgeousness (industrial design and v2 can always fix that), it has generally gone down badly in the press for the lack of open formats (no PDF, presumably this can be updated by software later), aggressive DRM, pricing, blog pricing and crazy terms and conditions (<super>þ</super>).</p>
<p>By far the best synopsis of the perfect storm of bad ideas that reach a conclusion in the Kindle offering is Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/11/19/the-future-of-reading">The Future of Reading (A Play in Six Parts)</a>.  Read this, and then reach for your copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/1984/dp/B000FA5U1E?tag=ballardcorner-20">1984</a>.</p>
<p>(þ) Amazon&#8217;s MP3 store also has steep terms and conditions (presumably to offset the non-DRM format of their music files) reducing your normal conditions for even digital music copyright quite drastically.  Remember, if you accept it, then you are bound by it, regardless of rights.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Concerned that this read too negatively, especially as I&#8217;m really just cross-posting Pilgrim&#8217;s rant, I thought I&#8217;d weigh the scales with this balanced &#8220;wait it out&#8221; from <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/712-kindle-ignites-the-flames">Signal vs. Noise</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kindle isnt the first eBook reader, but its the first portable bookstore. Thats novel. A book in 60 seconds whenever I want it at used-bookstore prices. And the daily push newspaper feature sounds like one hell of a bonus. I love getting the paper, but I hate getting the paper. What a complete waste of resources just so I can get yesterdays news. I like that theres some genuinely new thinking behind Kindle. We should embrace this, not tear it to shreds before it even has a chance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally I love the idea of a good eReader &#8211; too often the fantasy books I prefer clock in at 1000 pages and are large-format paperbacks.  It&#8217;s awkward to take one or two of these anywhere (especially totting a baby).  The whole DRM and lock-in is a big issue in the industry which is different from the iPod scenario &#8211; I can&#8217;t go to my bookshelf and &#8220;rip&#8221; my favourite books &#8211; I have to buy new ones from somewhere, and it would be nice to share.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a year since I announced my intention of taking <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2006/01/01/a-photo-per-day/">A Photo Per Day</a> and posting the results.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been cross-posting to flickr and the photos can also be seen in this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/machaggis/sets/72157594452126258/">A Photo Per Day Set</a> or via the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/machaggis/tags/aphotoperday/">aphotoperday tag</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy with the experiment &#8211; I had to keep a camera with me almost all the time, it forced me to take photos on slow days, long days, tired days.  It made me think of interesting shots at 11 p.m. at night, and tick a box with satisfaction at 8 a.m. some mornings.  I don&#8217;t really know if my photography improved but I certainly enjoyed the process and would recommend it and consider it again.</p>
<p>Technically I did fail to take a photo <i>every</i> day, what with international timezones and a couple of forgetful evenings &#8211; but there is always a catchup photo <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2006/06/01/31st-may-06-blurry-bookshelf-v/">in the wee small hours</a>, and that&#8217;s close enough to claim victory.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on a couple of new adventures in 2007 &#8211; <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/category/danika/baby-machaggis/">baby machaggis</a>, and another private enterprise that will probably not make the year.  Neither are photo projects although I imagine the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/machaggis/tags/noodlehead">camera may come out</a> for the little one.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s adventure was brought to you primarily by:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/template.php?goingto=dtc_options&#038;cat=1&#038;grp=2&#038;productNr=25504">Nikon Coolpix E5700</a> <b>4/5</b> &#8211; until the CCD failed this was my #1 digital camera, almost an SLR, veteran of the second half of the world trip.  Nikon replaced the CCD for free and returned the camera after a few months (two of them actually, due to a mess up, but by then my heart had been lost to the D50).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.steves-digicams.com/2004_reviews/dimagex50.html">Konica-Minolta DiMage X50</a> <b>5/5</b> &#8211; I can&#8217;t say enough great things about this little camera.  The X50 was bought as a small &#8220;Danika/party camera&#8221; so that when we went to France in 2004 she could take photos of me!  Konica-Minolta have left the camera business now (their SLR division has been bought by Sony) but if you ever see one of these little 5MP sweeties on a clearance shelf &#8211; buy it!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/template.php?goingto=dtc_options&#038;cat=1&#038;grp=2&#038;productNr=25216">Nikon D50</a> <b>4/5</b> &#8211; my second SLR, the first being a Minolta APS Vectis, I have had so much fun with this camera.  As with most SLRs it is way too complicated for me even though it is the bottom end of the digital SLR models!  Most of my shooting is on P mode, with some thumbwheel action to change speed or aperture while relying on the automatic exposure &#8211; which is how I used the E5700 too.  Unlike the E5700 the exposure is reliable (on the Coolpix I always preferred underexposing by 1/3) but it is important to do white balance properly as I generally take JPGs.  In 2007 I intend to move into the world of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAW_image_format">RAW</a>, where this will be less important but I will spend more time tweaking photos at the computer as a result.   Just to play fair, the camera doesn&#8217;t get 5/5 because: a) the LCD on top doesn&#8217;t have a backlight so you can&#8217;t see the settings in the dark, b) the white balance setting isn&#8217;t shown in the viewfinder so you need to remember what you left it set on and c) at only 6MP I get pixellation in the sky for some outdoor shots around clouds etc.   Being an SLR, let&#8217;s talk lenses:
<ul>
<li>18-55mm 1:3.5-5.6 G zoom <b>3/5</b> &#8211; basic lens that come with the camera, feels a little light and cheap, but pretty fine</li>
<li>55-200mm 1:4-5.6 G zoom <b>4/5</b> &#8211; big zoom that comes with the extended camera kit, it feels better than the small lens and takes nice zoomed pictures if you don&#8217;t shake too much!  I didn&#8217;t use it as much as I thought as the 55mm bottom end is often too &#8220;zoomed&#8221; when carrying the camera around for impromptu shots</li>
<li>50mm 1:1.8 D (fixed) <b>5/5</b> &#8211; Great for everyday use, and a little reminiscent of all those great older candids that were taken by great photographers using fixed lenses.  As its faster it suits my type of photography this year (better, sharper photos in low-light with no flash), and there is also one less dial to get wrong.  I loved it</li>
</ul>
<p>The D50 has been upgraded by Nikon and is now either the D40 or D80 depending on your price-range.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was going to finish up with a favourite photo from the series, but I just can&#8217;t choose.  So &#8211; similar to the picture bar that current runs across the top of <a href="http://bluefacedpixie">bluefacedpixie</a> &#8211; here is a random &#8220;aphotoperday&#8221; from flickr:</p>

It&#8217;s blurry and, yes, it&#8217;s games not books.
