								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nothing quite like a 4am foghorn to get you ready for Mt Doom, wow.  </p>
<p>The hike was quite wonderful, barren and sunny and very, very windy and this was a good introduction to the next few weeks where we do a lot of outside activities including a certain &#8220;adrenaline-junky&#8221; craziness for one girl.</p>
<p>But before that we start to head south, heading first for Wellington (where we see a massive Gollum at the movie theatre), and then cross the water to the South Island and start driving around.  </p>
<p>We rattled through a few places that in retrospect, while not metropolises (sp?) or major centres, we should have spent more than a day at (Christchurch, Mt Cook, Dunedin).  We had a great time, espcially with our new tent, which was a three man one and kept out insects etc (the previous tent had cost $15 or something at the Australian equivalent of Walmart, and while fine in the heat of Oz had suffered in NZ with being incredibly small and porous for the horrible biting insects of the North).  </p>
<p>For those who didn&#8217;t know, Christchurch &#8211; a charming old town &#8211; was mostly destroyed a couple of years ago in a big earthquake.  The wikipedia entry contains the phrase &#8220;<bold>liquefaction</bold> affected the eastern suburbs&#8221; &#8211; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Christchurch_earthquake.  So I guess the whole &#8220;earthquake mud slide&#8221; warning horn 4am alarm call wasn&#8217;t such paranoia after all.</p>
<p>And ten years ago tonight we stayed in Dunedin, which (along with a lot of NZ and particularly this area) is somewhat Scottish, being named after Edinburgh in Gaelic.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A week.  Floating light celebrations in Chang Mai.  Going motorcycle riding around Sukhothai&#8217;s ruins (fastest way to get around when there isn&#8217;t landmines &#8211; see Cambodia) and it was fun!  Now I can see why the trials riders all make great mountain bike riders but can&#8217;t cycle uphill.  Then we had a big-bang-maybe-last-night in Bangkok (yes, we were back again) before heading to Cambodia solely to tour Angkor Wat (on the basis that every-year-there-is-less-of-it or its-more-commercialized or we-might-never-be-in-this-neck-of-the-woods-again or we-can&#8217;t-do-too-many-ruins or can-we-do-more-ruins-in-Asia-than-museums-in-Europe or I-really-like-Tomb-Raider or really, it&#8217;s Angkor Wat, you *have* to go) as we were starting to feel schedule pinch and wanted to do this and even more Thailand before we headed further around the world, so no extended Cambodia or Vietnam sightseeing for us.  After paying our bribe/entry tax to Cambodia (I also have vague recollections of having *another* Swiss Army knife confiscated and might need to refresh my memory with Danika) we found a lovely civilised guest house, a tuk-tuk driver who was a fully qualified Doctor who couldn&#8217;t get work due to some historical war baggage and set off to see some ruins, ending our first day with Angkor Wat at sunset.  A week.</p>

My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/75561383">3 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>3 1/2 stars!</p>
<p>A nice contemporary delve into the world of ARGs.  Reminded me a lot of a more adult <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/954674.Little_Brother" title="Little Brother by Cory Doctorow">Little Brother</a>.</p>
<p>Hard to say much about this without spoilers, but the story blurs the lines between real events, alternative reality games and true gamer geekdom.  Works quite well but may date quite quickly so I recommend you read it now rather than later.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Take a deep breath.  Have the evening off.  </p>
<p>Since 7 o&#8217;clock I&#8217;ve had pizza, bathed and bedded the girl, chatted to D, read my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Powder-War-Novik/dp/159606207X/tag=ballardcorner-20">book</a> and now type away at this little missive.  Oh, wine open, being drunk.  No house work.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t expecting this &#8211; due to the immediacy of WA State real estate our &#8220;contingent offer&#8221; (followed by counter and counter-counter offer) would have required our little house to be listed for sale next Friday.  For better or worse, that offer failed and now we have a little breathing space.  Although we&#8217;ve been going 100% to &#8220;get ready for the impossible&#8221; for the last couple of days.  Our commiseration (we want that house, but not silly want, that&#8217;s one of the reasons there was a housing crash after all)/celebration (thank goodness, breathe&#8230;) involves TAKING THE NIGHT OFF!</p>
<p>Since <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2009/06/08/today/">Monday</a>, I&#8217;ve:</p>
<ul>
<li>sealed the grouting thing started on Monday</li>
<li>worked some surprising magic involving mud, yellow paint and the water leak in the kitchen</li>
<li>done some fixup involving sanding, bleaching, oiling on the backsplash area of the kitchen sink</li>
<li>scared myself by attempting to start to clean the basement</li>
<li>fixed the ceiling marks in the bathroom</li>
<li>de-rusted the banister</li>
<li>cleaned some paintwork</li>
<li>almost died of a cold/migraine/sleep deprivation</li>
<li>caulked in several places</li>
<li>painted the living room such that cranberry zing is no more and bland grey-green-ness rules</li>
<li>started painting the pocket door that people don&#8217;t know exists</li>
<li>added more to the to-do list than I&#8217;ve taken off</li>
<li>done all that &#8220;go to work and make money&#8221; stuff that normally generally consumes most of the week anyways&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;ve  had a staging consultation (UK: house doctor), which has left me with mixed emotions.  In general their goal is to &#8220;let the house speak for itself&#8221; and &#8220;be ready to move in to&#8221;  which basically means &#8220;remove yourself from the house&#8221; and &#8220;be bland&#8221;.  So we&#8217;ve been taking down pictures if they have the fam in them, packing crap in boxes to send to storage, and the consultant chose this awful shade of green to replace our red, red living room walls (*).  I&#8217;ll do it for the sale, but if it doesn&#8217;t sell then you&#8217;re in deep ****.  One of the reasons I&#8217;m so conflicted is that when *I* _look_ at houses, I _like_ to know it&#8217;s been lived in, see how people manage things (ahh, muddy boots _there_, kids crap _there_, if you didn&#8217;t have a 2000&#8243; TV then you could put a comfy chair _there_, etc&#8230;) and I know I can always erase their life if I don&#8217;t like it (**).  So the whole staging thing is counter to how I like to view houses (a little cleaning up never hurt) but then I guess we&#8217;re pretty atypical.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and the staging thing is why we&#8217;re in negative equity with the to-do list, which can naturally make anyone feel a little disgruntled, but having more than 2 weekend days and 4 nights to do it all in will make a world of difference.</p>
<p>And I tried to sum up my feeling on the staging <a href="http://twitter.com/machaggis/status/2157914313">here on twitter</a> (I think tweets should be <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2009/03/02/the_art_of_the_tweet.html">gems</a> approaching profound), repeated here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Staging a house is removing your soul from your home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enough for tonight. Tomorrow starts with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/machaggis/3055480388/">Besalu</a>, and then we return to the housework.  Thanks to everyone what has helped/volunteered/Lucy-watched so far.</p>
<p>(*) we had insipid blue and green walls (cross-painted) in the living/dining room when we moved in.  We blew it away with Cranberry Zing, a random red from the paint store.  Colour=character?  Too much for folks apparently. Ironically today&#8217;s green adventure is remarkedly similar to the green we blew away.</p>
<p>(**) despite the fact we dislike decorating/painting/renovating and just want to move in, it&#8217;s easy to make your mark (see (*)) and easy to unpack into different parts of an empty house.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m in the basement surrounded by LCDs and flickering lights.  There are no real lights on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the recent trials and tribulations with the house Internet have driven me to this.</p>
<p>Since Sunday our usually-pretty-rock-solid Internet has been playing silly buggers.  I think it&#8217;s the Apple TimeCapsule Airport thing, but I&#8217;m not too sure, although I&#8217;m pretty convinced.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s at times like this I wonder what <i>normal</i> folks do when technology doesn&#8217;t work.  And then I wish I was a <i>normal</i> person as I have just enough knowledge to be dangerous and maybe I wouldn&#8217;t be so concerned that the only solution seems to be to pull the cable out of the TimeCapsule (Apple didn&#8217;t give it an on/off switch) and plug it back in with that little pretty blue spark for about 12-hours of use before it somehow&#8230; stops working&#8230; and our backups haven&#8217;t run since last Friday&#8230;.  With all lights green and happy of course.</p>
<p>Tonight&#8217;s adventures in the attempted resolution (for I have no idea if, this time tomorrow, I won&#8217;t be using the F-word in REALLY LARGE CAPITALS) have involved downloading a lot of stuff to find out I have it already, using the cable direct from my DSL modem and doing a PPoE connection from my Mac to the outside world so I can google &#8220;TimeCapsule <strike>sucks</strike> randomly fails at simple internet&#8221;, running a full reset and reconfig on the TimeCapsule, being happy it currently works, and just waiting&#8230;.</p>
<p>However, thanks to the wonder of said Internet (when working) I have passed a small part of the evening quite wonderfully with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Next_Doctor">Christmas 2008</a> episode of Doctor Who.  This was following (also in a not-connected-to-the-outside-world patch) an equally (if not more so) pleasant experience with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Dead">Easter 2009</a> episode of Doctor Who.</p>
<p>These 2008 and 2009 specials are the swan song of the current Doctor (David Tennant, pretty damn fine), he&#8217;s retiring/due for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventh_Doctor">regeneration</a>, as is the Producer/Director <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_T_Davies">Russell Davies</a> who brought Doctor Who back to the BBC.  I&#8217;m excited to see the non-Davies Who as <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php?s=doctor+who">I think the current Who-franchise is fun, cheesy and way too rah-rah-London</a> to be sustainable and will age badly but does have complete strokes of genius.</p>
<p>But the current Doctor is sensitive and caring the way the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Doctor">Fifth Doctor</a> (aka <b><i>my Doctor</i></b> in the same way folks have <b><i>my</i> James Bond</b>) was (although many folks never gave Peter Davison the credit he deserved for that until later)  and these two episodes were good, even more so as they were isolated nuggets of goodness in a week fraught with frustration.</p>
