					<description><![CDATA[The router is setup to LAN one MAC address, Lazy WDS and WDS subnet are disabled.

The AX WDS is configured as a remote base station but I have disabled &quot;Allow wireless connections...&quot;.  So effectively I&#039;m not really using the WDS ability as the laptops hook up to the wireless router as opposed to the AX.   I&#039;m in a wooden 1917 house so there isn&#039;t anything particularly blocking our signals.

(I&#039;ve MacStumbled and executed Airport Client Monitor too - no named other networks or bad noise/weak signal at any time.  Occasionally bandwidth drops a little).

As I understand it, WDS isn&#039;t really necessary but I can&#039;t get an alternative configuration to work.

My next plan of attack is to borrow another AX and swap out the Linksys and see if this eliminates a variable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How is your WDS setup ? 
I&#039;ve seen a WDS setup that basically devoured itself by deciding to chain the relay nodes into a loop. I noticed it because of bad performance and lots of Airport Express dropouts. That said, it was an Apple-only setup and I didn&#039;t have the linksys element.]]></description>
