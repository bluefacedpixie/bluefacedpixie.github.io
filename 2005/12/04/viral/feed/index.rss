					<description><![CDATA[Goodness me, the pressure! Mine is a &quot;true blog&quot;!?

I would say that, yes, all of the above: bloggers are normal, geeky, and insular. Blogs and blogging are addictive! From a reader/lurker perspective, they are such a great way to keep in touch and share day to day/random musings that you wouldn&#039;t get in a phone call, snail mail, or email. From a blogger perspective, I&#039;ve really enjoyed having the creative outlet. It&#039;s a reason to write again and with such pleasure--without deadlines and with complete control over content. 

Finally, I think the bottom line really is where else could I write and you read about my toddler&#039;s puke? (Not sure who should be more embarssed about that one: Me for feeling the need to share it with the Internet or you for &quot;enjoying&quot; it!)

Thanks, Gordon (and Danika). Welcome to the blogosphere!]]></description>
