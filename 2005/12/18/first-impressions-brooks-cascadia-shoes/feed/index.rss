					<description><![CDATA[[...] This week&#8217;s trail run met all the requirements of a successful outing. We ran for a perfect length of time (about an hour and 38 minutes)- long enough to get a great workout and not so long that we&#8217;re completely wiped out for the rest of the day. The weather was lovely- a bit warmer than it has been and blue skies yet again. Both G and I had some new gear so that was fun. G&#8217;s already blogged about his shoes; my new item was a water bottle with a hand strap and a little pouch. You wouldn&#8217;t think a water bottle would be so hard to use but both G and I struggled to get water out of it. I&#8217;ll have to practice with it a home this week. This week&#8217;s damage: one ankle injury and a fall (no injury there). My ankle&#8217;s not too bad but I gave it a pretty solid WHACK from a fallen log. It&#8217;s kind of bruised and swollen but seems OK otherwise. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to prevent me from running. [...]]]></description>
