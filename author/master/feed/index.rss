								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>(Being a re-post of a ten-year old Yahoo groups newsletter update)</i></p>
<p>[Danika&#8217;s Family Home, Buffalo, NY, USA]</p>
<p>(g: we return to the US, after many newsletters from other countries)</p>
<p>We finally made it back to the US of A. Our adventures in exotic lands have ended. It was cold in Buffalo when we arrived &#8211; three days after sunbathing on the beach in Manly we were in 12 degree weather. And this time it was in Fahrenheit (-11 Centigrade!).</p>
<p>Our trip home was uneventful: China Air took us from Sydney to Taipei, Taiwan and onwards to JFK before we finally reached Buffalo. We spent almost a day in Taipei but didn&#8217;t see much except the National Palace Museum (which was pretty cool) and a lot of signs in Chinese.</p>
<p>Since arriving in Buffalo we&#8217;ve been adjusting through &#8216;post-trip blues&#8217;. We&#8217;ve visited Danika&#8217;s friends in Buffalo, been to a St. Patrick&#8217;s Day parade and stuffed our faces at the St. Joseph&#8217;s Day table in the nearby school.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re starting the mammoth task of working out how to get married this year (locations, dates etc.). We&#8217;re also starting to look for some form of gainful employment <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Our plans are ill-defined just now. We&#8217;ll probably hang in Buffalo until we can move Seattle-ways again, and if that doesn&#8217;t work out then we&#8217;ll look at other options.</p>
<p>Until we have something exciting to say this will be our last newsletter for a while (although a website may be coming soon), but feel free to contact us in Buffalo. We&#8217;re at (206)&#8230;., gordon@m&#8230;, danika@m&#8230; and just email us for the postal address.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>G &#038; D</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Day 241.  Two Hundred and Forty One Days.  Not even a year.  And we return to the USA and &#8220;finish&#8221; our travelling adventure.   From the last day in Australia we head to America by detouring to a final Asian stop in Taiwan.  Aided by a 22 (I think) hour layover we basically had enough time to sleep in a hotel and have a trip through Taipei to do the massive National Palace Museum.  And then we were back on a plane.  We overnighted in a dismal wet NYC in a generic airport Marriot and then had a pleasant Jet Blue flight back to Buffalo.</p>
<p>Our last official newsletter came out on the 20th of March that year, by which time we were a few weeks into settling back into an &#8220;untethered in America&#8221; routine.  I&#8217;ll post it in a couple of days.</p>
<p>Although our trip was over we were not quite done, and even the 20th of March update did not foresee the amount of things we would do before we settled into what would become our Ballard, Seattle, life for what has now been ten years.   In the remainder of 2003 we stayed in Buffalo for weeks (in the winter!), we made machaggis.net, Danika and the female Bondi&#8217;s headed off to Sicily, I drove across the USA in 4 days to take the Beetle back to Seattle, I re-upped with Amazon, I worked in the UK for the summer, I dealt with the INS (again), we returned to Seattle, got married (back in Buffalo) and we bought a little house in Ballard.   Our tumbleweed didn&#8217;t stop on March 5th, more like December 13th.  But we settled.  For now.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>(Being a re-post of a ten-year old Yahoo groups newsletter update)</i></p>
<p>[Andy &#038; Jane&#8217;s Abode, Manly, Australia]</p>
<p>Today we leave for the USA, we&#8217;ll be in New York tomorrow and Buffalo on Wednesday! It&#8217;s a bit more complicated than that due to time zones, but that&#8217;s the idea.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve enjoyed our short layover in Australia &#8211; getting back to the surf and beach of Manly has been great. This is especially true as our attempts to shake the rain clouds of New Zealand weren&#8217;t as successful as we would have wished. Our last week in Kiwi-land involved us hiking the Abel Tasman trail in the dark and rain (and wading rivers), travelling to Wellington to see the Lord of the Rings Exhibition and the Two Towers movie (again), visiting the `tres cool&#8217; art deco township of Napier, tasting wine in Hawkes Bay and visiting old friends&#8230;. By a great chance, Gordon&#8217;s university friends Gary and Gil, and their new addition Holly, were in Hamilton. Gary is doing a research and teaching sabbatical at the University of Waikato and we hung out with them for a couple of days as the rain poured down once more. Gordon is re-invigorated with techy-fever now, which should help when he starts to apply for new jobs in Seattle.</p>
<p>This weekend we arrived in Australia from New Zealand in a blaze of sunshine, which went down very well with both of us! We caught up on some badly overdue sights in Sydney (the Australian Museum &#8211; where Andrew works &#8211; and the botanical gardens), went on a couple of walks, Gordon went scuba diving (for the first time in a looong time), we swam, lay on the beach and went to the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. This was a fabulously entertaining event: dancing troops, happy crowds, ticker tape, floats and Thai food afterwards! We also had our last Aussie BBQ, this time on the deck in Manly &#8211; thanks Andy &#038; Jane!</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s that, two hundred and thirty nine (239) days, twelve countries (thirteen after today), one engagement, several pizzas and a glass or two of wine later&#8230;. we&#8217;re heading back to the US of A. Hope to see all our America-based friends soon, and we&#8217;ll send our next exciting instalment from the town of snow and Buffalo wings.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We leave NZ and return to Australia.  At long last Danika meets Andy and Jane (and vice versa) and we reside once more in Chez Donnelly-Allison in Manly.  We meet up again with Cameron, have a crazy run around time in Sydney, taking advantage of Andy &#038; Jane&#8217;s insider knowledge.  Andy drags me out scuba diving, for the first time in a very, very long time (certificate validity, *cough*, *cough* etc); I almost max out in an unrelated boogy boarding rip-tide incident and we go for what would be a nice hike except for Andy&#8217;s knowledge of things that can sting, maim, hurt and occasionally kill you putting us somewhat on guard.  Oh yeah, and there were forest fires approaching Sydney. All of that served to distract us from the upcoming final leg of the trip.  Back to the USA, which is going to be, once more, home &#8211; somewhere.</p>
