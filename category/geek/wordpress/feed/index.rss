								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tried out <a href="http://bing.com">bing!</a> today as an alternative to google.  When I searched for the machaggis.net blogs bing faithfully returned them with a lot of spam/SEO optimized crap that looks like it&#8217;s inserted into <a href="http://bluefacedpixie.com">bluefacedpixie</a> and <a href="http://planetdanika.com">planetdanika</a>.</p>
<div class="imgcenter"><img src="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/wp-content/hacked.jpg" width="400" alt="" /></div>
<p>Yup, somewhere along the line I&#8217;ve been hacked.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve let the robotic logins slide for waaay too long, relying on the math plugin to prevent comment spam, but somewhere my decrepit, embarrassingly old, installation of WordPress has been goosed.</p>
<p>So, sometime in the near future we will go offline and I will attempt to rectify the hackery.  Even though I should be either mountain biking or working on the house.  Damn, and I&#8217;m taking this Friday off too.</p>

<p>In the world of geek, machaggis.net moved hosting providers.</p>
<p>We left <a href="http://luxsci.com">luxsci.com</a> and moved to <a href="http://www.sustainablewebsites.com/">sustainablewebsites.com</a>.</p>
<p>What this means for machaggis.net:</p>
<ul>
<li>no top page on machaggis.net as I&#8217;ve only moved the blogs
</li>
<li>the blogs are all working (tell me if they are not)
</li>
<li>new email systems (but our email addresses are the same)

<p>For the occasional reader, it should mean nothing is different (perhaps a re-flush of RSS feeds, perhaps a lost email in a very small window today).</p>
<p>Luxsci was fine, but a little more serious and industrial strength than our little family website needed and now we&#8217;re <a href="http://www.sustainablewebsites.com/wind-power">wind-powered</a>, eco-friendly and have <a href="http://www.sustainablewebsites.com/green-web-hosting-services">oodles of more stuff</a> for less money.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, it had to happen.  I&#8217;ve been spending time fixing spam issues on some of my little websites and have also ran into an email spam problem.</p>
<p>First of all, the website issues.  From the turn of the year I noticed a large spike in comment spam hitting <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org">ballardcornerspark.org</a>.  This isn&#8217;t really that surprising &#8211; its a public website, we broadcast the address, and the @ballardcornerspark.org email addresses get hosed all the time.    I cranked out google and <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org/ballardcornerspark/index.php/2007/02/21/admin-note-spam-protection/">found a couple of nice plugins for WordPress 2</a> that I installed and the problem disappeared (so far!).  Basically a simple math question to post a comment and also a tool to close old posts from comments.</p>
<p>And then a few days ago, <a href="http://bluefacedpixie.com">bluefacedpixie</a> started to get hit too (mostly from one bad IP address that I could block) at least 2 comments an hour.   The cutting edge of fame &#8211; my <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2007/01/15/nice-design-lifetime-warranty/">Ridgid post</a> was spotlighted at <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/286-designed-movie-poster-of-the-year-bill-sullivan-photographs-ridgid-drill-and-new-coins">Signal vs. Noise</a> which probably led robots to find the bfp blog &#8211; my own little version of being slashdotted (and my bandwidth use did jump too&#8230;).  I started to get repetitive strain injury with the whole &#8220;mark all as spam&#8221; comment moderation so tonight added a couple of additions along the same lines to bluefacedpixie.  The same <a href="http://sw-guide.de/wordpress/math-comment-spam-protection-plugin/">Math Comment Spam Plugin</a> as used on ballardcornerspark, but I used a simpler <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/Auto_shutoff_comments">Comment Shutoff</a> because this blog is older with a more hacked installation of WordPress (note to self: someday take the time to upgrade to WordPress 2).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let you know how they do &#8211; by the time I finish this post I will have missed a few timeslots for new spam to arrive.  </p>
<p>If successful then I suppose the rest of the family (<a href="http://planetdanika.com">planetdanika</a>, <a href="http://machaggis.net/premodernist">premodernist</a> and <a href="http://machaggis.net/thanksgiving">Ringraziamento</a>) will all need the same treatment.</p>
<p>And now we get to the sad tale of my email address and <i>other people&#8217;s computers</i>.  A few weeks ago I sent out Lucy&#8217;s birth announcement to what we could conservatively call half the English-speaking world.  Mostly using email addresses provided by D.   As D was busy <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2007/01/22/i-may-be-distracted-for-some-time/">that day</a> I sent out the email: to <i>self</i>, bcc <i>known universe</i>, from <i><b>me</b></i>.  Ooops.</p>
<p>Since that day I&#8217;ve been getting hit by email spam much more than normal: Spam Assassin is failing at my host provider, Apple Mail&#8217;s pretty-crappy Junk filter fails to catch them and my carefully crafted &#8220;smack it dead unless it&#8217;s sent to me&#8221; filter also fails.   Mostly stock market spam, very well done most of it too.   My only assumption is that some of the recipients of the birth email are hacked/spambotted/virused and my very visible &#8220;from&#8221; email address is now on more spammers sell lists that previously.  Bugger.  I should have used a more temporary email address, but we so wanted those replies.</p>
<p>If you received the Lucy announcement and read this blog, and people you email complain about all the spam they get &#8211; you might want to run a little &#8220;clean my computer&#8221; magic on the old Windows box.</p>
<p>No spam so far, I&#8217;m going to bed.</p>

<a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org">Ballard Corners Park</a> search wasn&#8217;t working after you left the top page &#8211; the redirect for the form post was just wrong.</p>
<p>But I compare the <a href="http://bluefacedpixie.com">bluefacedpixie</a>, <a href="http://planetdanika.com">planetdanika</a> and ballardcornerspark <code>sidebar.php</code> and &#8220;permalinks&#8221; and &#8220;general&#8221; options and all was the same.</p>
<p>Mmmmm.  I&#8217;m not hitting <code>index.php</code>, but the configs are the same.  Is it a &#8220;.org&#8221; conspiracy?  I think not.  The WordPress versions are different &#8211; the Park is the only website on WordPress 2, everything else is on 1.5 (bad, I know, go away).</p>
<p>I added the <code>index.php/</code> to the action on the ballardcornerspark search though, and it all worked.<br />
<code></p>
<form id="searchform" method="get" action="index.php/<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>"><br />

<p>Sweetness, check that box, next bug, it&#8217;s all non-profit time.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8230;once more.</p>
<p>For the last couple of weeks I&#8217;ve been making myself unpopular with Danika by geeking out over some volunteer work.</p>
<p>Yes, I ended up being the webmonkey for Ballard Corners Park.  The co-chair had done a stellar job on maintaining a good static site with a basic solid design with FrontPage.  But times moved on and he wanted to get more dynamic so that he didn&#8217;t have to send out so many emails to his emailing lists and also to allow others to contribute.  He wanted a blog.  I obliged, but ended up <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>ing the whole site into WordPress as a CMS and reverse-engineering his FrontPage WYSIWYG into a theme.  And then backing off on a lot of the design because it looked *too much* like the old site, and we wanted something that looked a little newer and <em>blog</em>.</p>
<p>I may have a few geeky stories to tell if I care &#8211; about finding a new email encoder that WordPress could re-post without screwing up, about how using the WordPress 2.0 WYSIWYG editor screws that up *and* seems to blow away <code></p>
<p></code> and <code><br /></code> tags.   But it&#8217;s too late for objective descriptions (and last Monday these descriptions would be have been anything <i>but</i> objective). So&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;please go play at the <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org/ballardcornerspark">BallardCornersPark</a> to be, it&#8217;s going live this weekend so if you see anything broken, want to vomit, or would like to improve it significantly &#8211; use the comments on this post (I&#8217;m expecting none due to readership levels, so don&#8217;t feel bad).  The original site (for now) is at <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org">http://ballardcornerspark.org</a> &#8211; for reference.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Messing about with <a href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress</a> archives.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve made a couple of very minor updates to <a href="http://bluefacedpixie.com">bluefacedpixie</a>. It was a lesson, as always, in humility and a sharp reminder that doing simple geek-things is often harder than expected.  More after the (more)<span id="more-576"></span>.</p>
<p>For a while I was wanting to display mostly chronological entries in  my blog by title only.   Originally I thought it would be a good little &#8220;hack my aging WordPress 1.5.x installation&#8221; exercise to let me putter about with <a href="http://php.net">PHP</a>.  So as Danika napped tonight I started into it.  Almost immediately I was impressed though that <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> has thought of all this before and a combination of <code>get_archives("type=monthly')</code> in the <code>sidebar.php</code> and the addition of an <code>archive.php</code> to customize the <code>index.php</code> display (so I could then add in title only display rather than post display) would do the trick.  So I decided to do it the &#8220;wordpress way&#8221;.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s mostly done now.  There&#8217;s a new section in the sidebar for <strong>Ancient History</strong> that will take you to a simpler title listing, and as a &#8220;feature&#8221; this also works for categories due to the WordPress template code.  It actually looks good but isn&#8217;t what I was originally expecting (I thought the <code>category-X.php</code> files overrode that display).</p>
<p>I also tidied up a few things in the sidebar and tried to the move the verbose &#8220;you are now browsing&#8230;&#8221; string to the main page before leaving it in the sidebar in a new position.</p>
<p>It took much longer than expected, but I got there &#8211; one hour turned into three (with a little blog at the end of course).</p>
<p>The most significant hoop:</p>
<p>I wanted to display as many titles as I could per page (limited to 100, just in case&#8230;) and this required me to add this code before <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop"><strong>The Loop</strong></a>:</p>
<p><code>< ?php $query_string = "posts_per_page=100&#038;" . $query_string; 
query_posts($query_string);
?></code></p>
<p>So I&#8217;m basically hacking into the global variable (<code>$query_string</code>) that was used to set up the initial query, adding my restriction and rerunning it (<code>query_posts()</code>) before the loop.  Not efficient (as <code>query_posts()</code> fires twice, once in WordPress, again in the template) but necessary to override the first question.  It doesn&#8217;t work quite right though as&#8230;.</p>
<p>The <code>show_page</code> variable isn&#8217;t processed correctly in the &#8220;Next Page&#8221; logic &#8211; it appears a &#8220;Next Page&#8221; will always appear and (if there are less than 100 posts) move onto a page with no results.   Bad, but liveable.</p>
<p>A final bugette seems to be the <code>get_excerpt()</code> call, initially I wanted to use this with <code>title=</code> on the blog titles to get a popover effect, however the <code>get_excerpt()</code> doesn&#8217;t strip HTML, giving an ugly display (it is meant to) so I skipped it in this iteration.  </p>
<p>All in all &#8211; WordPress surprises once more, but not quite as easily as I&#8217;d like, but I&#8217;d be faster with more familiarity.</p>
<p><em>Epilogue: As my much hacked template is based on the GPL&#8217;d <a href="http://ckunte.com/archives/2005/03/07/plain-vanilla-1/">Plain Vanilla</a>, contact me if you want a complete copy of the theme.</em></p>

				<description><![CDATA[In a brief attempt at being Web 2.0, I&#8217;ve removed the category listing from the sidebar and added a &#8220;category cloud&#8221; lower in the sidebar, and at the bottom of the main page.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a brief attempt at being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a>, I&#8217;ve removed the category listing from the sidebar and added a &#8220;category cloud&#8221; lower in the sidebar, and at the bottom of the main page.  One of them will go shortly.</p>
<p>The wordpress plugin came from <a href="http://hitormiss.org/projects/weighted-categories">hitormiss</a>, which I got to from a random search that hit this <a href="http://www.cebidae.com/2006/07/13/category-cloud/">blog</a> &#8211; and I&#8217;m glad because he included the little <code>id="categories"</code> part I had missed.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know what a category cloud is this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud">wikipedia</a> definition may help (or go visit <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/machaggis/tags/">flickr</a>).</p>
<p>So far it really only serves to note that I post a lot of _a photo per day_.  I also took the opportunity to fiddle with a couple of minor things I&#8217;ve had comments about &#8211; the placing of the date (who cares) and finding the comment link (important!).   And I did manage to fix an extremely minor and annoying style bug &#8211; that no-one probably ever noticed &#8211; at the same time, so you can sleep easy at night. </p>
<p>Of course this all took way too long, as I don&#8217;t really know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a> and pretty much learn as I go.</p>
<p>_Update: You can&#8217;t see the changes on an RSS feed, you have to head to <a href="http://bluefacedpixie.com">bluefacedpixie</a> directly._</p>
