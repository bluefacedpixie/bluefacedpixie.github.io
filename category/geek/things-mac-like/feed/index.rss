<p>iPad as a toy? Oh yeah, best product out there. iPad as a computing device. When things go wrong, they go really, really wrong.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After playing with my recent app purchase &#8211; <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ithoughtshd-mindmapping/id369020033?mt=8">iThoughtsHD</a> &#8211; for an hour or so, I once more stop to reflect on the backwards nature of software development and user experience and useful &#8211; as opposed to checklist feature-creep &#8211; functionality.  </p>
<p>Where does the useful stuff go?</p>
<p>Why do folks think it&#8217;s ok to stop doing the few basic things that UI and faster CPUs sweat blood on during the 80s, 90s and lost in the 2000s?  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking:</p>
<p>* copy and paste &#8211; hello iPhone, and ummm hello windows phone 7?<br />
* in-app find &#8211; hello web 2.0, browser search is not find, is not incremental search, is not find and replace<br />
* in-app find &#8211; hello APPLE! Didn&#8217;t you learn from the previous bullet? I want to find things in mail and safari and now you have an absolute gazillion apps hanging out on your AppStore all copying your piss poor example!<br />
* undo &#8211; I mean, really. Emacs had it. We made fun of web 2.0 apps. And now the whole barmy mobile world thinks it&#8217;s a good idea to treat delete like an atom bomb unless they hide it in some stupid ass gesture like shake. I&#8217;m sorry, I reserve shake for when I&#8217;m shouting at my technical gadgets while threatening to throw them out the window for not having bl**dy undo. </p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t just lose a whole branch of my first iThoughts mindmap by using delete and discovering there was no undo. </p>
<p>Ok, I did. B*gger. It&#8217;s still wrong.  </p>

<p>Since I bought the compulsive netbook a few years ago I have gone places I never dreamt.  Ubuntu, Mac OS X hacked installs, Windows 7 Betas.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve also <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2008/11/05/heres-what-i-did-on-halloween-scary/">*opened a computer*</a>.  I cringe at the thought.  I&#8217;m a software guy.  Virtual is good.  Anyway, 2 nights before going to Mexico I dropped the netbook, blew the LCD and deprived L of a portable entertainment machine.  My punishment was 1) to lug 6+lbs of MacBook Pro to Mexico to do nothing and 2) to tread once more into the world of _really small screws_.  So I replaced the LCD tonight using <a href="http://bespokeblog.wordpress.com/2009/10/18/how-to-replace-the-lcd-screen-on-an-acer-aspire-one/">these mostly-right instructions</a> and a sub $100 with shipping screen from North Vancouver (src: China) of all places.  It went well.  I may post the one photo later, but really it&#8217;s all blas√© now and I&#8217;m starting to be more of a soldering guy.</p>
<p><i>Not.</i></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m in the basement surrounded by LCDs and flickering lights.  There are no real lights on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the recent trials and tribulations with the house Internet have driven me to this.</p>
<p>Since Sunday our usually-pretty-rock-solid Internet has been playing silly buggers.  I think it&#8217;s the Apple TimeCapsule Airport thing, but I&#8217;m not too sure, although I&#8217;m pretty convinced.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s at times like this I wonder what <i>normal</i> folks do when technology doesn&#8217;t work.  And then I wish I was a <i>normal</i> person as I have just enough knowledge to be dangerous and maybe I wouldn&#8217;t be so concerned that the only solution seems to be to pull the cable out of the TimeCapsule (Apple didn&#8217;t give it an on/off switch) and plug it back in with that little pretty blue spark for about 12-hours of use before it somehow&#8230; stops working&#8230; and our backups haven&#8217;t run since last Friday&#8230;.  With all lights green and happy of course.</p>
<p>Tonight&#8217;s adventures in the attempted resolution (for I have no idea if, this time tomorrow, I won&#8217;t be using the F-word in REALLY LARGE CAPITALS) have involved downloading a lot of stuff to find out I have it already, using the cable direct from my DSL modem and doing a PPoE connection from my Mac to the outside world so I can google &#8220;TimeCapsule <strike>sucks</strike> randomly fails at simple internet&#8221;, running a full reset and reconfig on the TimeCapsule, being happy it currently works, and just waiting&#8230;.</p>
<p>However, thanks to the wonder of said Internet (when working) I have passed a small part of the evening quite wonderfully with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Next_Doctor">Christmas 2008</a> episode of Doctor Who.  This was following (also in a not-connected-to-the-outside-world patch) an equally (if not more so) pleasant experience with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Dead">Easter 2009</a> episode of Doctor Who.</p>
<p>These 2008 and 2009 specials are the swan song of the current Doctor (David Tennant, pretty damn fine), he&#8217;s retiring/due for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventh_Doctor">regeneration</a>, as is the Producer/Director <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_T_Davies">Russell Davies</a> who brought Doctor Who back to the BBC.  I&#8217;m excited to see the non-Davies Who as <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php?s=doctor+who">I think the current Who-franchise is fun, cheesy and way too rah-rah-London</a> to be sustainable and will age badly but does have complete strokes of genius.</p>
<p>But the current Doctor is sensitive and caring the way the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Doctor">Fifth Doctor</a> (aka <b><i>my Doctor</i></b> in the same way folks have <b><i>my</i> James Bond</b>) was (although many folks never gave Peter Davison the credit he deserved for that until later)  and these two episodes were good, even more so as they were isolated nuggets of goodness in a week fraught with frustration.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Dead">Planet of the Dead</a> (Easter 2009 Special): <b>4/5</b><br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Next_Doctor">The Next Doctor</a> (Christmas 2008 Special): <b>3/5</b></p>

<p><b>Hell, no!</b></p>
<p>(repeat, LOUDER)</p>
<p><b><large>HELL, NO!</large></b></p>
<p>Admittedly I am using the ships-with-the-computer versions of iMovie and iDVD (iMovie 6 and iDVD &#8217;06 I believe) as opposed to the iLife &#8217;08 versions; but this is hardly an advert for spending money on Apple software.</p>
<p>To save me having to type lots of expletives, or Karima-level exclamation points, the answer is <b>NO, F**K NO!</b>.   72 hours in, still fighting.</p>
<p>One result:</p>
<p><code>grandvizier:~ gordon$ cat ~/scripts/every-x-do-y<br />
</code><code>#!/bin/bash<br />
</code><code><br />
</code><code>while true; do $2; sleep $1; done<br />

</code><code>grandvizier:~ gordon$ cat ~/scripts/kill-syslogd<br />
</code><code>#!/bin/sh<br />
</code><code>echo "sudo required"<br />
</code><code>sudo launchctl stop com.apple.syslogd<br />
</code><code>sudo rm -f /var/log/asl.* /var/log/system.log*<br />
</code><code>sudo launchctl start com.apple.syslogd<br />
</code><code><br />
</code><code>grandvizier:~ gordon$ sudo every-x-do-y 300 kill-syslogd<br />
</code></p>
<p>For the geeks amongst us, this is my sledgehammer to the <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=8267806">discussions.apple.com</a> solution for this problem (QT hates badly encoded movies and is coded by a three-year -old):</p>

<p>So, if you get a shiny disk with Lucy on it, and it actually works &#8211; it was made with blood and hours.</p>
