								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It may be counting chickens, but if the godaddy forwarding kicks in within the next few hours <a href="http://fortheloveofgoditsmascarpone.com">fortheloveofgoditsmascarpone.com</a> will be the internet&#8217;s most recent &#8220;<a href="http://isthisyourpaperonsingleservingsites.com/">Single Serving Site</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m rusty, rusty but in the last 72 minutes to starting to write this post:</p>
<ol>
<li>Registered <strong>fortheloveofgoditsmascarpone.com</strong> at <strong>godaddy.com</strong>
</li>
<li>Realized they have less free things than they used to
</li>
<li>Forwarded it to <strong>http://machaggis.net/fortheloveofgoditsmascarpone.com</strong> (still to kick in at this instant) with framing
</li>
<li>Registered for <em>AdWords</em>, realized its the wrong thing
</li>
<li>Registered for <em>AdSense</em>, have a sneaking suspicion I may have done this before years ago, get told to wait two or three days
</li>
<li>Hacked up (with too much google love) the <strong>index.html</strong> page
</li>
<li>Messed around with fonts, styles, underlines and margins
</li>
<li>CVS my launch files (all one of them: <strong>index.html</strong>)
</li>
<li>Upload to <a href="http://machaggis.net/fortheloveofgoditsmascarpone.com">http://machaggis.net/fortheloveofgoditsmascarpone.com</a> (use this link if the forwarding isn&#8217;t working yet)
</li>
<li>Comment on Danika&#8217;s single serving site Facebook post with cross-advertising for: <a href="http://fortheloveofgoditsmascarpone.com">fortheloveofgoditsmascarpone.com</a>
</li>
<li>Write this blog post
</li>
<li>Re-edit this blog post with bolds for all the non-linked domain names
</li>
<li>Retire to richness, fame, and internet-geekery.  I could have been unpacking I guess.</li>
</ol>
<p>Good night.</p>
<p><i>Update:</i> And then we fiddle again and smartquote the main page &#8211; the lack of curly quotes was quite unsightly.</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s all blown away, clean redeploy from the <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2009/01/03/no-one-reads-my-blog-anyway/">initial January deploy on this ISP</a>, passwords changed, <a href="http://twitter.com/machaggis/status/2647233954">MD5</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/machaggis/status/2647230133">cronjob</a> installed, users disabled on the blogs&#8230;. and we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t yet resolved to upgrade <a href="http://wordpress.org">WP</a> (hopelessly out of date that it is) because frankly I think this was some other hack.  But it could have been an old WP php hole, so I will probably upgrade in the future.  It&#8217;s just going to be so much work (uncustomizing the templates, reworking plugins etc) as opposed to this rather brute force method, and I&#8217;m still busy at work and have the girls back to play with, and have missed so much summer due to the <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/category/house/">House</a> already that&#8230; bugger it&#8230; if the MD5&#8217;s hold, the old WP stays!</p>

<p>Yup, somewhere along the line I&#8217;ve been hacked.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve let the robotic logins slide for waaay too long, relying on the math plugin to prevent comment spam, but somewhere my decrepit, embarrassingly old, installation of WordPress has been goosed.</p>
<p>So, sometime in the near future we will go offline and I will attempt to rectify the hackery.  Even though I should be either mountain biking or working on the house.  Damn, and I&#8217;m taking this Friday off too.</p>

<p>In the world of geek, machaggis.net moved hosting providers.</p>
<p>We left <a href="http://luxsci.com">luxsci.com</a> and moved to <a href="http://www.sustainablewebsites.com/">sustainablewebsites.com</a>.</p>
<p>What this means for machaggis.net:</p>
<ul>
<li>no top page on machaggis.net as I&#8217;ve only moved the blogs
</li>
<li>the blogs are all working (tell me if they are not)
</li>
<li>new email systems (but our email addresses are the same)
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the occasional reader, it should mean nothing is different (perhaps a re-flush of RSS feeds, perhaps a lost email in a very small window today).</p>
<p>Luxsci was fine, but a little more serious and industrial strength than our little family website needed and now we&#8217;re <a href="http://www.sustainablewebsites.com/wind-power">wind-powered</a>, eco-friendly and have <a href="http://www.sustainablewebsites.com/green-web-hosting-services">oodles of more stuff</a> for less money.  C&#8217;est la vie.</p>
<p>Welcome to the New Year.</p>

<p>I bailed on Accelerando after slogging at it for a couple of eternities (having a sabbatical for Last Light of the Sun in the process).  I started Wee Free Men with a joy that can only come of light hearted Terry Pratchett-expectation.   It was a solid TP, without being great.  Apparently the follow-up to this particular book (TP has about 100 books in Discworld and about) is even better (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hat-Full-Sky-Discworld/dp/B000CDG85G/?tag=ballardcorner-20">A Hat Full of Sky</a>).<br />
For the curious, The Wee Free Men in this particular book were the inspiration of the <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2005/11/16/welcome-to-the-bluefacedpixie/">bluefacedpixie name</a>.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, it had to happen.  I&#8217;ve been spending time fixing spam issues on some of my little websites and have also ran into an email spam problem.</p>
<p>First of all, the website issues.  From the turn of the year I noticed a large spike in comment spam hitting <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org">ballardcornerspark.org</a>.  This isn&#8217;t really that surprising &#8211; its a public website, we broadcast the address, and the @ballardcornerspark.org email addresses get hosed all the time.    I cranked out google and <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org/ballardcornerspark/index.php/2007/02/21/admin-note-spam-protection/">found a couple of nice plugins for WordPress 2</a> that I installed and the problem disappeared (so far!).  Basically a simple math question to post a comment and also a tool to close old posts from comments.</p>
<p>And then a few days ago, <a href="http://bluefacedpixie.com">bluefacedpixie</a> started to get hit too (mostly from one bad IP address that I could block) at least 2 comments an hour.   The cutting edge of fame &#8211; my <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2007/01/15/nice-design-lifetime-warranty/">Ridgid post</a> was spotlighted at <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/286-designed-movie-poster-of-the-year-bill-sullivan-photographs-ridgid-drill-and-new-coins">Signal vs. Noise</a> which probably led robots to find the bfp blog &#8211; my own little version of being slashdotted (and my bandwidth use did jump too&#8230;).  I started to get repetitive strain injury with the whole &#8220;mark all as spam&#8221; comment moderation so tonight added a couple of additions along the same lines to bluefacedpixie.  The same <a href="http://sw-guide.de/wordpress/math-comment-spam-protection-plugin/">Math Comment Spam Plugin</a> as used on ballardcornerspark, but I used a simpler <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/Auto_shutoff_comments">Comment Shutoff</a> because this blog is older with a more hacked installation of WordPress (note to self: someday take the time to upgrade to WordPress 2).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let you know how they do &#8211; by the time I finish this post I will have missed a few timeslots for new spam to arrive.  </p>
<p>If successful then I suppose the rest of the family (<a href="http://planetdanika.com">planetdanika</a>, <a href="http://machaggis.net/premodernist">premodernist</a> and <a href="http://machaggis.net/thanksgiving">Ringraziamento</a>) will all need the same treatment.</p>
<p>And now we get to the sad tale of my email address and <i>other people&#8217;s computers</i>.  A few weeks ago I sent out Lucy&#8217;s birth announcement to what we could conservatively call half the English-speaking world.  Mostly using email addresses provided by D.   As D was busy <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2007/01/22/i-may-be-distracted-for-some-time/">that day</a> I sent out the email: to <i>self</i>, bcc <i>known universe</i>, from <i><b>me</b></i>.  Ooops.</p>
<p>Since that day I&#8217;ve been getting hit by email spam much more than normal: Spam Assassin is failing at my host provider, Apple Mail&#8217;s pretty-crappy Junk filter fails to catch them and my carefully crafted &#8220;smack it dead unless it&#8217;s sent to me&#8221; filter also fails.   Mostly stock market spam, very well done most of it too.   My only assumption is that some of the recipients of the birth email are hacked/spambotted/virused and my very visible &#8220;from&#8221; email address is now on more spammers sell lists that previously.  Bugger.  I should have used a more temporary email address, but we so wanted those replies.</p>
<p>If you received the Lucy announcement and read this blog, and people you email complain about all the spam they get &#8211; you might want to run a little &#8220;clean my computer&#8221; magic on the old Windows box.</p>
<p>No spam so far, I&#8217;m going to bed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve indirectly mentioned Ballard Corners Park before, in <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2006/06/15/15th-june-06-ballard-corners-park/">a photo per day</a> in June.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now time, however, to throw my hat (and heart) in the ring and do the full on &#8220;<em>nothing-comes-for-free-in-America-isn&#8217;t-neighbourhood-fund-raising-a-great-thing</em>&#8221; thing.</p>
<p>I live in Ballard (<a href="http://www.inballard.com/">inballard</a>, <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Seattle/Ballard">wikipedia</a>), it&#8217;s a nice little community but by a freak of its past it&#8217;s short of <i>green spaces</i> i.e. parks.   </p>
<p>A few blocks from our house there are two lots that are being re-purposed for a neighbourhood park under the <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/PARKS/proparks/acquisition.htm">Green Spaces/Pro Parks Levy</a>.  Politics aside, we hope to build (in 2008) a child-friendly park that can act as a locus for the local families.   Ballard is so short of parks that the open area built beside the public library as part of a corporate &#8220;we want to build condos on top of our grocery store&#8221; deal is frequented by <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2006/07/20/20th-july-06-fountain/">children in the summer</a> (ok, the fountains help).</p>
<p>The working title for this project is <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org">Ballard Corners Park</a> and the committee is called <b>Friends of Ballards Corners Park</b>.  More details can be found at the main website at <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org">http://ballardcornerspark.org</a>.  I say the working name of the park is &#8220;Ballard Corners&#8221; only because the final name is decided by the Seattle Parks dept. and will probably be named after a dead councillor&#8217;s wife or Bill Gates&#8217; dog.  But that&#8217;s not really the point.</p>
<p>The park costs upwards of $400,000.  Yup, <b>$400,000</b>.  Not cheap but <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org/images/second%20community%20meeting/1763PreferredPlan.pdf">it looks good</a>.  And a significant portion of the money has to be raised through fund-raising, sponsorship and &#8220;matching&#8221;.</p>
<p>Although not part of the committee I&#8217;ve been helping out in whatever way I can.  Danika and I have attended a few meetings and banked a few volunteer hours.  Danika has planted bulbs in the rain to pretty-up our wasteland lot for the spring.  I&#8217;ve helped out on the pending t-shirts.  And I&#8217;m helping raise money from friends and family by skimming affiliate money for a good cause from internet shopping monsters such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/?%5Fencoding=UTF8&#038;tag=ballardcorner-20&#038;linkCode=sb1">Amazon.com</a>.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re about to shop at Amazon.com to buy Danika a 30th birthday present (hint, hint) or Thanksgiving or the pending holidays.  Don&#8217;t <i>just</i> shop at Amazon.  Shop at Amazon by using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/?%5Fencoding=UTF8&#038;tag=ballardcorner-20&#038;linkCode=sb1">this link</a>, or going to <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org/shop">ballardcornerspark.org/shop</a> (where hopefully over time more than Amazon will be featured), or access the <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/ballardcorner-20">Ballard Corners Park Amazon Store</a>.</p>
<p>This method gives upwards of 4% of revenue to the funds, and you can bet every little helps.  We&#8217;re also working with local companies (such as <a href="http://elephantsgerald.com/">Elephants Gerald</a> for t-shirts) so this represents an ability for non-locals to help the community Danika and I live in.</p>
<p>And you&#8217;re going to see links appear both on <a href="http://bluefacedpixie.com">bluefacedpixie.com</a> and <a href="http://planetdanika.com">planetdanika.com</a> in the near future (once I recover from a Mac wipe that has set me back weeks in terms of technology).    These features use Amazon links to perform magic recommendations that are relevant to <i>you</i>, but we will also use simple &#8220;shop at amazon&#8221; links too:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?%5Fencoding=UTF8&#038;node=1&#038;tag=ballardcorner-20&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325">Photo Books at Amazon.com</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ballardcorner-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>
<p>and search boxes:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=ballardcorner-20&#038;o=1&#038;p=27&#038;l=qs1&#038;f=ifr" width="180" height="150" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>All of these will credit money to our parks project.  You can also make non-profit tax free donations using <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org/Help_Us/">these instructions</a>.</p>
<p>And finally, if you are an internet/blog user (I&#8217;m looking at <a href="http://hellionwarden.blogspot.com/">hellion</a> and <a href="http://dogcow.org/">dogcow</a> and my readership of 3 here) then add these links to your blogs/websites (sorry for the crappy wrapping and naff formatting):</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8230;but if you jump over to <a href="http://planetdanika.com">planetdanika</a> using Safari (on a Mac) then the header &#8220;planetdanika&#8221; has a nice shadow to it.  This makes it stand out when the white header is on a bright photo background.  A lovely touch brought about with this one line:</p>
<p><code>#header { text-shadow: #111111 0.1em 0.1em 0.2em }</code></p>
<p>There&#8217;s more though: <span id="more-607"></span></p>
<p>It took 2 minutes to add this, and it looked so nice I did the same up top to bluefacedpixie.  However this story skips the part where I spent a good couple of hours wrestling with making a drop shadow that worked in browsers other than Safari &#8211; because IE and Firefox don&#8217;t support the CSS3 <code>text-shadow</code>.</p>
<p>Most googling brought me to some CSS that looked like this:<br />
<code><br />
.shadowMe, .shadowMe span { position: relative; margin: 0; padding: 20px; text-align: right;}<br />
span.shadow {position: absolute; 	text-align: right; padding: 0, 0, -20px, 0; }<br />
span.shadow {<br />
	top: 1px;<br />
	left: 1px;<br />
	color: #777777;<br />
}<br />
</code></p>
<p>and accompanying use of <code>class</code> and <code>span</code> in the markup where I wanted the shadow. I couldn&#8217;t get it to work and right adjust the header, mostly due to my lack of CSS-fu.  As I didn&#8217;t want to flip all of the images in planetdanika&#8217;s header files to put her on the right I have currently abandoned this approach and left the sites Safari-only-friendly.</p>
<p>It annoys me when simple things are simple, and then don&#8217;t work, and the workarounds suck so much time and fiddling.  Mmm.</p>
