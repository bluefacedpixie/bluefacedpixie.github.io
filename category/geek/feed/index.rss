								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I did any typing in bluefacedpixie but <a href="http://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/11/watch-a-vc-use-my-name-to-sell-a-con/">jwz&#8217;s reality call</a> needs as many cross-links for ye-olde-google-backrub as possible.</p>
<p><i>I did make a bunch of money by winning the Netscape Startup Lottery, it&#8217;s true. So did most of the early engineers. But the people who made 100x as much as the engineers did? I can tell you for a fact that none of them slept under their desk.</i></p>
<p>So:</p>
<p><i>I recommend that you do what you love because you love doing it. If that means long hours, fantastic. If that means leaving the office by 6pm every day for your underwater basket-weaving class, also fantastic.</i></p>

<p>iPad as a toy? Oh yeah, best product out there. iPad as a computing device. When things go wrong, they go really, really wrong.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After playing with my recent app purchase &#8211; <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ithoughtshd-mindmapping/id369020033?mt=8">iThoughtsHD</a> &#8211; for an hour or so, I once more stop to reflect on the backwards nature of software development and user experience and useful &#8211; as opposed to checklist feature-creep &#8211; functionality.  </p>
<p>Where does the useful stuff go?</p>
<p>Why do folks think it&#8217;s ok to stop doing the few basic things that UI and faster CPUs sweat blood on during the 80s, 90s and lost in the 2000s?  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking:</p>
<p>* copy and paste &#8211; hello iPhone, and ummm hello windows phone 7?<br />
* in-app find &#8211; hello web 2.0, browser search is not find, is not incremental search, is not find and replace<br />
* in-app find &#8211; hello APPLE! Didn&#8217;t you learn from the previous bullet? I want to find things in mail and safari and now you have an absolute gazillion apps hanging out on your AppStore all copying your piss poor example!<br />
* undo &#8211; I mean, really. Emacs had it. We made fun of web 2.0 apps. And now the whole barmy mobile world thinks it&#8217;s a good idea to treat delete like an atom bomb unless they hide it in some stupid ass gesture like shake. I&#8217;m sorry, I reserve shake for when I&#8217;m shouting at my technical gadgets while threatening to throw them out the window for not having bl**dy undo. </p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t just lose a whole branch of my first iThoughts mindmap by using delete and discovering there was no undo. </p>
<p>Ok, I did. B*gger. It&#8217;s still wrong.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like Macs.  They work.  Built well.  Look pretty.  OS X is my kinda thing, I&#8217;m a Unix with pretty graphics kind of guy.</p>
<p>Since I bought the compulsive netbook a few years ago I have gone places I never dreamt.  Ubuntu, Mac OS X hacked installs, Windows 7 Betas.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve also <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2008/11/05/heres-what-i-did-on-halloween-scary/">*opened a computer*</a>.  I cringe at the thought.  I&#8217;m a software guy.  Virtual is good.  Anyway, 2 nights before going to Mexico I dropped the netbook, blew the LCD and deprived L of a portable entertainment machine.  My punishment was 1) to lug 6+lbs of MacBook Pro to Mexico to do nothing and 2) to tread once more into the world of _really small screws_.  So I replaced the LCD tonight using <a href="http://bespokeblog.wordpress.com/2009/10/18/how-to-replace-the-lcd-screen-on-an-acer-aspire-one/">these mostly-right instructions</a> and a sub $100 with shipping screen from North Vancouver (src: China) of all places.  It went well.  I may post the one photo later, but really it&#8217;s all blas√© now and I&#8217;m starting to be more of a soldering guy.</p>
<p><i>Not.</i></p>

<p>I&#8217;m rusty, rusty but in the last 72 minutes to starting to write this post:</p>
<ol>
<li>Registered <strong>fortheloveofgoditsmascarpone.com</strong> at <strong>godaddy.com</strong>
</li>
<li>Realized they have less free things than they used to
</li>
<li>Forwarded it to <strong>http://machaggis.net/fortheloveofgoditsmascarpone.com</strong> (still to kick in at this instant) with framing
</li>
<li>Registered for <em>AdWords</em>, realized its the wrong thing
</li>
<li>Registered for <em>AdSense</em>, have a sneaking suspicion I may have done this before years ago, get told to wait two or three days
</li>
<li>Hacked up (with too much google love) the <strong>index.html</strong> page
</li>
<li>Messed around with fonts, styles, underlines and margins
</li>
<li>CVS my launch files (all one of them: <strong>index.html</strong>)
</li>
<li>Upload to <a href="http://machaggis.net/fortheloveofgoditsmascarpone.com">http://machaggis.net/fortheloveofgoditsmascarpone.com</a> (use this link if the forwarding isn&#8217;t working yet)
</li>
<li>Comment on Danika&#8217;s single serving site Facebook post with cross-advertising for: <a href="http://fortheloveofgoditsmascarpone.com">fortheloveofgoditsmascarpone.com</a>
</li>
<li>Write this blog post
</li>
<li>Re-edit this blog post with bolds for all the non-linked domain names
</li>
<li>Retire to richness, fame, and internet-geekery.  I could have been unpacking I guess.</li>
</ol>
<p>Good night.</p>
<p><i>Update:</i> And then we fiddle again and smartquote the main page &#8211; the lack of curly quotes was quite unsightly.</p>
