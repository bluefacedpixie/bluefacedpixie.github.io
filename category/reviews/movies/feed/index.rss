<p>I knew I had a sour or two taste in my mouth after the mostly enjoyable Star Trek re-boot movie, and I think this was one of them.  (The whole &#8220;time travel in Star Trek&#8221; was another, and a desperate need for beer was another).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My progress has been stunning.  <i>Our</i> progress has been stunning.</p>
<p>Even though our need to sell is no longer burning, we are so damn close &#8211; the to-do list is somewhat dented and we could turn it around at any time in a frenzied week.   And then we would have to move out or at least put our child in a box for the duration or something during the &#8220;keep it perfect&#8221; staging period.</p>
<p>My progress, personally, has continued through a list of things I have no real interest in (*) and don&#8217;t want to get better at: painting, deck staining (**), moving furniture, truck driving, touch-up (6 different colours yesterday), woodworking (***), weeding, bird-shit-from-house-cleaning, pretty-flower-planting, ikea-furniture-assembling&#8230;  However, it still quite amazes me that someone as practically-limited as myself can still manage to produce average results at such a variety of tasks with no training (****).  The internet and help from friends definitely makes all the difference.</p>
<p>Our commitment level and progress has led to an almost slacker pace of achievement this weekend (*****).  Many things were still done, but we went to a fun BBQ yesterday and this evening I totally ducked the basement (******) and rented a brutally bad movie that I watched with D for brownie points (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/My-Blueberry-Nights-Miriam-Collection/dp/B0016MJ6HY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=dvd&#038;qid=1246253135&#038;sr=8-1&#038;tag=ballardcorner-20">My Blueberry Nights</a> &#8211; 1 bfp star and slow&#8230;.), I also rented <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Taken-Single-Disc-Extended-Liam-Neeson/dp/B001TODCII/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=dvd&#038;qid=1246253174&#038;sr=1-1&#038;tag=ballardcorner-20">Taken</a> which I&#8217;m sure is much better.    This was also our first time watching a movie with the girl, which went ok.  We&#8217;re both kinda freaked that she knows how to play <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_d_2_8?url=search-alias%3Ddvd&#038;field-keywords=curious+george+dvd&#038;x=0&#038;y=0&#038;sprefix=curious+&#038;tag=ballardcorner-20">Curious George</a> from Front Row on my Mac though&#8230;</p>
<p>This week we buckle down to do some house hunting before some travel gets in the way &#8211; our potential house is gone, to a higher or more reliable bidder, and the pickings are scarce.  Timetable is on.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>(*) not to say there is no sense of achievement for a Program Manager (aka deals with compromise resolution all the time) in Software (aka lives in a virtual world): moving a pile of dirt and changing the colour of a room has a certain definitive physicality to it.</p>
<p>(**) I almost enjoyed this as I borrowed Keith&#8217;s pressure washer and used it for the first time.  I think I overdid it in a few places, but those things are cool.  I think I need to add one to my inventory of tools I almost never use &#8211; see (****).</p>
<p>(***) this could be something <a href="http://twitter.com/machaggis/status/2375378328">I could grow to like</a>, but it&#8217;s still hacking away with little skill.</p>
<p>(****) although it is nice to use some of those random tools that you buy that makes every trip to <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/">Home Depot</a> $300.</p>
<p>(*****) I really slacked &#8211; 6 weeks ago I bailed on <a href="http://www.rnrseattle.com/">Saturday&#8217;s marathon</a> (the <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2009/06/03/lets-go/">trip to Whistler</a> tipped the balance on my training), in practicality the house meant even the half went bye-bye.</p>
<p>(******) this task is the big remaining elephant, both the shop side (anyone need some random old crappy bikes, and parts?) and the office side (how to make a rat&#8217;s nest of cables look clean withough just stuffing all the hard drives and printers under the stairs etc)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My friend Morgan and I are getting frustrated.  There&#8217;s this big comic-book movie out this week &#8211; <a href="http://watchmenmovie.warnerbros.com/">Watchmen</a>, based on a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0930289234/ballardcorner-20">seminal graphic novel</a> from 23 years ago now that is a little dated (remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_war">the Cold War</a>?) and morally ambiguous.  But today&#8217;s entertainment is all morally ambiguous, so it&#8217;s not that different.</p>
<p>But the problem is, we can&#8217;t work out if the movie&#8217;s a good big-screen <i>blast</i>.  We like to go watch big action movies in the <a href="http://seattlecinerama.com">Cinerama</a>.  It&#8217;s great.  It almost makes bad movies good.</p>
<p>All the movie reviews are quagmire&#8217;s of comparison of the movie to the comic for comic-nerds, or how its not relevant anymore, etc, etc (<a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/movies/2008813538_mr05watchmen.html">e.g.</a>).  I want to know if I should go watch it.  I probably will.</p>
<p>Anyway, in my browsing for a good review, here is <a href="http://www.studio360.org">Studio 360</a>&#8216;s non-<a href="http://www.studio360.org/episodes/2009/03/06">review</a> (embedded audio below) &#8211; but it&#8217;s really relevant to the cultural impact of the original book, all those years ago.</p>
