<p><strong>Rule 1.</strong><br />
When married to someone with Sicilian ancestry, don&#8217;t eat at Italian restaurants, because you *know* she can do it better.<br />
<strong>Rule 2.</strong><br />
When eating at an Italian restaurant, don&#8217;t order the pasta, because you *know* _anyone_ can cook pasta.<br />
<strong>Rule 3.</strong><br />
When ordering pasta at an Italian restaurant in Scotland, be sure to order the one with black pudding, because *you know* no Italian would ever do anything like _that_.<br />

</div>
<p>The random internet search/Joy of Baking <a href="http://joyofbaking.com/SconesCoffeehouse.html">recipe</a> with comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2 cups (280 grams) all purpose flour</p>
<p>1/4 cup (50 grams) granulated white sugar</p>
<p>1 teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</p>
<p>1/4 teaspoon salt</p>
<p>1/2 cup (113 grams) (1 stick) unsalted butter, cold and cut into pieces</p>
<p>2/3 cup (160 ml) buttermilk <i>(G &#8211; 2/3 cup of low fat with a 3/4 tablespoon of vinegar does nicely)</i></p>
<p><i>1 handful of dried cherries</i></p>
<p>Egg mixture for brushing tops of scones:</p>
<p>1 large egg, lightly beaten</p>
<p>1 tablespoon milk</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and place rack in middle of oven.  Stack two baking sheets together and line the top baking sheet with parchment paper.  (This prevents the bottoms of the scones from over browning during baking.)</p>
<p>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Cut the butter into small pieces and blend into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or two knives. The mixture should look like coarse crumbs.  Add the buttermilk to the flour mixture and stir just until the dough comes together. Do not over mix the dough.</p>
<p><i>(G &#8211; don&#8217;t know what a pastry blender is, can&#8217;t find it (we have one apparently) and I have small child beside me, pretty much ruling out all sharp knives except the one I used to dice the butter.  Get your hands in there and mush it all up small)</i></p>
<p>Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead dough gently four or five times and then pat, or roll, the dough into a circle that is about 7 inches (18 cm) round and about 11/2 inches (3.75 cm) thick. Cut this circle in half, then cut each half into 3 pie-shaped wedges (triangles).  </p>
<p><i>(G &#8211; throw some flour on the worksurface and do all this.  Then remember you forgot to add the cherries.  Add cherries on top of nice circle of dough.  End up kneading it all again.  Now kneaded 100 times.  Make new ball and roll into nice circle.  Then realize you need to cut into six pieces with sharp knife.  On top of your nice wooden worksurface with small child beside you.  Be careful, shielding eyes of small child.)</i></p>
<p>Place the scones on the baking sheet.  Make an egg wash of one well-beaten egg mixed with 1 tablespoon milk and brush the tops of the scones with this mixture.</p>
<p><i>(G &#8211; why one big egg?  I brushed and brushed and still had half the stuff left.  Oh well, more food for small child.)</i></p>
<p>Bake for about 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.   Remove from oven and then turn your broiler on high.  Sift confectioners (powdered or icing) sugar heavily over the tops of the scones and place them under the broiler.  Broil for just a few seconds, turning the pan as necessary, until the sugar has melted and turns golden brown.  Make sure to watch the scones carefully as the sugar will burn very quickly.   Transfer to a wire rack to cool.</p>
<p><i>(G &#8211; use the big oven.  20 minutes is perfect (checked at 15/19/20). Wax paper will smoke.  Warm gently under broiler, blink and you will have burnt sugar, which is almost a track from the Rolling Stones, but not quite.)</i></p>
<p>Makes 6 scones.</p>
<p><i>(G &#8211; like, duh, you cut the big circle into 6 earlier, right?  Good to know when skimming the recipe though.)</i></p>
<p><i>(G &#8211; cool enough to eat within 10 minutes.  The most important part of any baking recipe, should be mandatory. 6 scones is about 3 normal greedy person servings btw.)</i>
</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Danika, from <a href="http://orangette.blogspot.com/2008/05/something-more-exciting.html">one of her food blogs</a>, the drink of the summer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Gordons Cup</strong><br />
Adapted from Bon Appétit, April 2008</p>
<p>We used Tanqueray gin for this drink  its our usual brand  but Plymouth would also be very nice. We served it in wide-mouth champagne glasses, but you could also use a rocks glass, which is what the original recipe recommends. Oh, and before you start, note that the quantities listed below make only one serving. You can scale them up easily, though.</p>
<p>To make the simple syrup called for below, combine 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water in a small saucepan, and stir over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Rais! e the heat, and boil for 1 minute. Cool the syrup to room temp! erature; then store it in the fridge indefinitely. (Or, if you cannot be bothered to make simple syrup, you can use superfine sugar to taste.)</p>
<p>2/3 of a small lime, cut into 6 wedges<br />
2 (½-inch-thick) rounds of peeled cucumber<br />
¼ cup gin<br />
1 to 1 ½ Tbsp. simple syrup<br />
Ice<br />
Pinch of sea salt</p>
<p>Place the lime and the cucumber in a cocktail shaker, and mash them with a muddler or wooden spoon until the lime is juiced and the cucumber is pulpy. Add the gin, 1 Tbsp. simple syrup, and 1 cup ice. Cover, and shake vigorously three times. (At this point, I recommend tasting a little bit: you might want a splash more gin, or a bit more simple syrup.) Pour the contents of the shaker into a glass  with or without some ice, as you see fit. Sprinkle with salt.</p>
<p>Note: To garnish this, you could use a wedge of lime or a thin sliver of cucumber. Brandon, however, wants to try a sprig of mint or cilantro next t! ime.</p>
<p>Yield: 1 serving</p></blockquote>
<p>How can you not like 1 serving that has 1/4 cup of gin?  Ok, so really that&#8217;s only 1.5 oz &#8211; but who says you need to use regulation cup sizes!!!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Strange how I had to go to Helsinki to have one of the nicer Indian meals for a while.</p>
<p>I ate at the <a href="http://namaskaar.fobos.fi/">Namaskaar</a>, which Google Maps said was 100ft from my hotel but it was really more like 1/2 mile (Google Maps is not good with street numbers if you are in a country that is not America).</p>
<p>I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn&#8217;t finally succumbed to jetlag-crash &#8211; when I returned to the hotel I was gone, gone, gone and it definitely affected me at the Indian.</p>
<p>As usual, the dishes were mostly recognizable but strange things happened to the names &#8211; the Murgh Masala I had last night was more or less what I know as Jalfrezi, but that made no difference to the excellent flavour.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, the Malaysian embassy in Finland has a handy list of restaurants by cuisine &#8211; the Namaskaar was high on its list &#8211; but I won&#8217;t link to it as it seems very slow (and may really be running from Malaysia on a 9600 baud line by the looks of things).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Other titles for this post included <em>I miss Seattle</em>, <em>How do you find Coffee?</em>, <em>When did I become a city boy?</em> and  <strong><em>The Explanation Of Awesome</em></strong>; but somehow I think I am going to talk about food.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on the road in Virginia and am finding myself in an America I first discovered in the mid-nineties.  I&#8217;m sitting in a hotel where the nearest thing of significance is a mall.  Across the next major junction is &#8211; another mall.  Food in this area (because unfortunately this Marriott Courtyard only does breakfast) is &#8211; the mall.</p>
<p>Wow.  I&#8217;ve got too used to city life.  The ability to find food in restaurants that, at most, have five locations in the same town.   I never needed to choose between chains so much &#8211; Red Robin, Uno, Chili&#8217;s, Longhorn, Chuck &#8216;E Cheese (sic), Macaroni Grill etc&#8230;  Now I&#8217;m a fan of these guys and their persistence and omnipresence across America &#8211; nothing beats being dog-tired on the road after mountain-biking/hiking/boarding/goofing-off and seeing them at the side of the road.  But as an <i>everyday eating option</i>?</p>
<p>So here is the reckoning so far: <i>Uno&#8217;s</i> &#8211; poor, <i>M &#038; S Grill</i> (maybe a chain, something in a more city-like downtown Reston) &#8211; actually good, great steak, <i>Chili&#8217;s</i> &#8211; average.  But the deal is, Chili&#8217;s already started to feel <strike>great</strike> <i>good</i>.  Need I even say <i>Awesome?</i>.   Has my ever-ending Scottish challenge with American &#8220;awesome&#8221; (aka &#8220;it&#8217;s alright&#8221;) actually been due to the blandness of the-only-available-food?  I need to think about this.</p>
<p>So rather than go on, I will sideline into coffee.  I think I&#8217;ve discovered one of the few places in the Universe that has a deficiency in Starbucks.   I&#8217;ve not been to a local one yet, but did find one on the route to see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/machaggis/sets/72157600087524667/">Minté</a> at exit 33 (Conneticut Drive) on the I-something.  Paul was very impressed by my homing instinct.  But <i>really</i> how do people survive without espresso here???  I did find a <a href="http://www.dailygrindunwind.com/">Daily Grind</a> <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?&#038;q=44650+Waxpool+Road%2C+Suite+100+Ashburn+VA+20148+US">here</a> yesterday, but have gone a day cold-turkey (i.e. only <i>filter</i>).</p>
<p>This is strange, but I go <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/machaggis/463434694/">home soon</a>.</p>
