<p>My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/82215843">4 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>My first real &#8220;steampunk&#8221; novel. So good I bought it twice (well ok, received it as a gift, left it on vacation, bought another copy to finish it).</p>
<p>Set in a fantastical 19th Century Seattle infested with zombies, entombed in a wall, swirling in poisonous gas (with liberal mixing in of Seattle landmarks even if the years are a little wrong) just a solid fun read.  One slight bum note with the whole &#8220;hanging pathway&#8221; part and some big ass plot signposting, but in general every one of the four stars well earned.  </p>
<p>Will be reading the sequels when they get written &#8211; although watching the author&#8217;s progress at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://cheriepriest.com">cheriepriest.com</a> is not the best way to lower anticipation.</p>

<p>Pretty solid read but not the best Rebus/Rankin.</p>
<p>Interestingly set and intertwined with real events around the G8 summit in 2005 (and the London 7/7 bombings) as the Rebus books become contemporary the essential murder story at the heart ends up relying on too much coincidental connections, being in the right place at the right time and the unlikely nexus of events.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t skip it, but wouldn&#8217;t read it first.</p>
<p>(Yet another digital library ebook &#8211; yahoo!)</p>

Brutally bad, even with low expectations.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s better to say little rather than rant.</p>
<p>Do not read this, even if it&#8217;s a paper-saving ebook from the library and you quite liked the other Dan Brown books in a he&#8217;s-not-a-great-writer-but-the-story-is-quite-jolly kind of way.</p>
<p>Or to put it another way &#8220;The Lost Symbol was like a slow motion train wreck &#8211; tragic but once started it just kept going.&#8221;</p>

My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/76427527">3 of 5 stars</a><br />
Slightly impenetrable to start but it quickly became a captivating read.</p>
<p>Nicely paced through two storylines with a particular dense type of writing that requires skipping back a few paragraphs to check for missed phrasing every now and then.</p>
<p>Somewhat expected ending in terms of style (and sheer expectation based on pace of story and number of pages left) but with a reasonable twist.  Felt a little cinematic.</p>
<p>Strange use of conversational quoting:</p>
<p>&#8213;Hello there.  Rudy said.</p>
<p>As opposed to:</p>
<p>   &#8220;Hello there&#8221;, Rudy said.</p>
<p>Must google it or something.</p>

<p>Billed as a &#8220;return to form&#8221; (although apart from the more recent <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/886104.The_Steep_Approach_to_Garbadale" title="The Steep Approach to Garbadale by Iain M. Banks">The Steep Approach to Garbadale</a> I haven&#8217;t really had any issues, especially the <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7628.Iain_M_Banks" title="Iain M. Banks">Iain M Banks</a> sci-fi as opposed to the <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7628.Iain_M_Banks" title="Iain M. Banks">Iain Banks</a> thrillers (which tend to be weaker).  (Ok, goodreads and the US indexing system doesn&#8217;t highlight this discrepency so go view it at: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Banks">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Banks</a>).</p>
<p>This is meant to be <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2839.Bridge_to_Terabithia" title="Bridge to Terabithia by Katherine Paterson">The Bridge</a>-like and also to straddle his genres.</p>
<p>It starts well but then establishes itself as a fairly standard mega-parallel-verse-with-assassins story using Banks&#8217; multiple-first person characterizations.  It soon flattens out and then degenerates into a confused, plot-lost, random sex scene, deus ex.., get-out-of-jail-free story with very little satisfactory conclusion.  Even the exit &#8216;gotcha&#8217; was less telling that the Sympathy for the Devil exit of Fallen (ok, an old average movie reference mixed with a book like this doesn&#8217;t really make that much sense, but it&#8217;s what leapt to mind).</p>
<p>I also think I spotted a couple of inconsistencies with the whole shifting thing, but would need to re-read it to be sure, and it may be that Banks was just trying to be really clever and I missed it.  But its not going to be high on my re-read list, whereas several other Banks are: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12009.The_Algebraist" title="The Algebraist by Iain M. Banks">The Algebraist</a>, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12016.Look_to_Windward" title="Look to Windward by Iain M. Banks">Look to Windward</a> and <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12015.Feersum_Endjinn" title="Feersum Endjinn by Iain M. Banks">Feersum Endjinn</a>.</p>
<p>Disappointing, but even so it still averages out well above a bad book and is a jolly little read with some interesting insight into the minds of assassins, torturers, drug dealers and random mostly unsavoury characters.</p>

My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/73017362">3 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>A nice little book about a wildly disturbed 12-year old boy with an anger problem.  </p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t like the last two pages of the ending (no spoilers) and the protagonist thinks like characters in Dawson&#8217;s Creek talk &#8211; verbosely and way above their age level.  Indeed many of the events of the book strike me as a little age-askew.  Another off-note is the year of the setting &#8211; I might have missed it, but it doesn&#8217;t seem like 2009 to me (lack of video games, DVD, computers etc) and harkens to simpler times (the Cruiser bike) while still seeming to have a few modernistic splashes of psychology and peer pressure&#8230;</p>
<p>The book starts with a Marlowe/noir feel and sort of loses it as you get more into the main character, but it&#8217;s a natural progression.</p>
<p>Most noticeable, this is my first Overdrive ebook for the Seattle Public Library on my eReader (the other books I borrowed are waaay to long to read just now) and made for excellent vacation on/off reading.</p>

My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/67336824">2 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>Initially I bought this book thinking it would be a good primer on USA history.</p>
<p>Over the years it sat on my bookshelf I realized I should not expect that as I learn of <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1899.Howard_Zinn" title="Howard Zinn">Howard Zinn</a>, hear him on NPR a few times etc.</p>
<p>So, what do we end up with?</p>
<p>A long history of the USA from the &#8220;losers&#8221; (aka &#8220;people&#8217;s&#8221;) side. This is how Zinn portrays it.  There are few victories, no joyous moments and only endless oppression and cruelty.  And a repeated contrast on how history is written and how it was received by some segments.  For readers who need this wake-up call, this is well done (and I&#8217;ve chatted to one person who was in University where this book made them realize that history was &#8220;written by the winners&#8221; as the cliche goes), for others it gets&#8230;. depressing.</p>
<p>Especially without a lifetime of alternative/standard US history indoctrination this comes across strong, often without the needed context.  And it&#8217;s neither truly impartial or biased in as much as it&#8217;s clear there is an agenda here but it&#8217;s not clear what the agenda is other than showing the &#8216;other side&#8217;.  No solution is offered for a better way, no new doctrine or different &#8216;historical winner&#8217; is forthcoming, its lose, lose, lose for the People&#8217;s History.</p>
<p>All I can say is that I&#8217;m glad I read it in the summer when the skies are blue, but I was glad to lay it down and move onto other things (the etext of <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/73149.Scott_Lynch" title="Scott Lynch">Scott Lynch</a>&#8216;s <em>Queen of the Iron Sands</em> and then <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/search/search?q=James Feurst" title="James Feurst">James Feurst</a>: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5806175.Huge_A_Novel" title="Huge  A Novel by James Fuerst">Huge: A Novel</a> with <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2833413.Iain_Banks" title="Iain Banks">Iain Banks</a> <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6436659.Transition" title="Transition by Iain M.

<p>My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/66905971">2 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>A pretty good pre-world war thriller come spy novel that ended somewhat on a dud note or rushed.  The author seemed to run out of steam, or was setting up for a sequel, or tried to play the ending very low key and hit the wrong note.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t read any <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/49941.Alan_Furst" title="Alan Furst">Alan Furst</a> before, but reading other reviews it seems his other books are better, if not great, and the ending of this book was a little atypical.</p>
<p>I did enjoy my easy read of this and the main character (a Parisian Reuters correspondent who is an anti-Fascist Italian emigre) is very enjoyable.</p>
<p>Maybe more Furst in the future.<br />
