<p>I&#8217;m a sad Mac fan, but I&#8217;ve a pretty aggressive hate/love with some of the &#8220;easy to use&#8221; applications that come with the Mac &#8211; such as iTunes.<br />
Finally though, <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/">iTunes 7</a> was released this week and allows me to set an album as &#8220;gapless&#8221;.   What does this mean?  It means that between songs on an album it will neither give a little 1 second gap or crossfade one song into another (ala cheesy radio). Instead there will be a continuous flow of perfect music.<br />
My old concept album-loving self is so happy.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/FB00005QK3B/belufacedpixi-20">Misplaced Childhood</a> is perfect once more.</p>

These guys pretty much rocked, although the sound was poor towards the back of the meadow, and they even managed to get participation from the usually clinical and comatose Seattle band crowd.<br />
It was our first Zoo Times, and we&#8217;ll go back, especially as it seems to be very kid friendly.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past couple of days I&#8217;ve discovered (re-discovered) the crusty old band &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who">The Who</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>It started with the closing song of the 14th episode of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009WPM1Q/bluefacedpixi-20">House MD</a>.   Catchy, familiar, it turned out to be <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=401674&#038;s=143441&#038;i=401656">Baba O&#8217;Reilly</a> (aka Teenage Wasteland) from The Who.  When I went to download it though I also discovered that <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=3440660&#038;s=143441&#038;i=3440657">Who Are You</a> is the theme to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008972G/bluefacedpixi-20">CSI</a>, and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=3595466&#038;s=143441&#038;i=3595438">Behind Blue Eyes</a> is the &#8220;no one every thinks the bad guy has feelings&#8221; song that has been popping up on Seattle radio (the commercial stations, not <a href="http://kexp.org">KEXP</a>) recently.</p>
<p>Feeling quite pleased with myself I downloaded a handful of songs from one of the greatest hits (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002P1N/bluefacedpixi-20">My Generation: Very Best of The Who</a>), only to discover that it&#8217;s a little too old-school rock for Danika.   We have a large common ground, but I think this will be iPod-only for me until I manage to sneak the songs into a playlist when Danika isn&#8217;t expecting them.</p>

<p>I would have liked to see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000B0WODA/bluefacedpixi-20">Franz Ferdinand</a> higher, as although I wasn&#8217;t keen on the album early on it definitely grew on me through the year.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000AADYRQ/bluefacedpixi-20">Death Cab for Cutie</a> that high in the top 10 is nice.  And it seems to be a KEXP tradition that I never seem to have heard the #1 vote (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009R1T7M/bluefacedpixi-20">Sufjan Steven, Illinois</a>).</p>

<p>However I also played around last weekend with <a href="http://www.pandora.com" title="pandora">pandora.com</a>, which isn&#8217;t a radio station but is really fun in terms of finding music you like, or may like.  I admit I did play around using bands that I liked in the 80&#8217;s and still like (umm&#8230;. *Queen* and *Marillion*) but the related music was interesting and the *genome* of the music &#8220;electronic guitar&#8221; etc was enlightening.  </p>
<p>Give it a play &#8211; why not?  (Unless you don&#8217;t have broadband of course).</p>
