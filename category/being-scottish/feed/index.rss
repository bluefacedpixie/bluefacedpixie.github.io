<p><strong>Rule 1.</strong><br />
When married to someone with Sicilian ancestry, don&#8217;t eat at Italian restaurants, because you *know* she can do it better.<br />
<strong>Rule 2.</strong><br />
When eating at an Italian restaurant, don&#8217;t order the pasta, because you *know* _anyone_ can cook pasta.<br />
<strong>Rule 3.</strong><br />
When ordering pasta at an Italian restaurant in Scotland, be sure to order the one with black pudding, because *you know* no Italian would ever do anything like _that_.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>..on the shores of the far side of the 2000 decade.</p>
<p>A decade review  seems to be an invitation for lists; I will try to keep it short and sweet.</p>
<p>It seems strange that so much focus was placed on the end of the millennium (Y2K, phew), when the last ten years have been so full for me and so much has happened in the world.  I was in transition in 1999 as I waited for a visa to come through to let me work for an internet company in Seattle (even as the dot bomb began&#8230;), and little did I know the tradition of <a href="http://dht240.wordpress.com/2009/12/30/on-reaching-the-end-of-the-decade/">heading off for New Year&#8217;s Eve with friends</a> would be drawing to a close.</p>
<p>This year doesn&#8217;t seem that different from the last in terms of &#8220;closing out&#8221;, but decades make a nice number to chunk time by.  I&#8217;ve had the childhood decade, the teenage years, the &#8220;being adult in Scotland&#8221; decade and now&#8230; the last ten years:</p>
<p>* moving to the USA to work (and now living here on a more permanent basis)<br />
* destroying my accent<br />
* starting most sentences with &#8220;So&#8230;&#8221;<br />
* having an original iPod (deceased)<br />
* and an original iPhone (still working)<br />
* publishing random bits of stuff on the internet in a blog-thing&#8230;<br />
* taking a small trip around the world with a girl<br />
* &#8230;and marrying her&#8230;<br />
* &#8230;and becoming a family of four</p>
<p>So while this decade ends in diapers,  the next decade is going to involve a lot of homework, school runs and play.</p>
<p>See you on the other side.</p>
<p>Happy New Year.</p>

My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/61149641">5 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>Loved every piece of this book.  One of the best non-fiction I have read.</p>
<p>Six chapters/sections on various &#8220;British&#8221; scientific endeavors: Black Knight (Rockets to Space!), Concorde (Wow!), Elite, Cellphones (I still hate Oftel), DNA (Saving the Human Genome project from corporate America) and Beagle 2 (our last, best hope).</p>
<p>Every one well written.  Every one a good length.  Every one compelling.</p>
<p>In a parochial somewhat British way all of these stories struck a chord, but they are also great stories.  I&#8217;m a non-scientific geek (see stories 1 &#038; 6).  I work with cellphone software (see story 4); my high school years impacted by the games world of Elite (see story 3); Concorde is&#8230; Concorde (see story 2) and the Human Genome Project and Wellcome Trust (story 5) makes me believe defeating corporate America is possible (it was almost stolen from the world, and the American public by the American law that forbids the State to compete against private enterprise).</p>
<p>You might also like <a href="/book/show/52202.How_Mumbo_jumbo_Conquered_the_World" title="How Mumbo-jumbo Conquered the World by Francis Wheen">How Mumbo-jumbo Conquered the World</a> if you like this; but read this first.</p>

<h3>My review</h3>
<p></a><br />
  rating: 3 of 5 stars</p>
<p />
Interrupted <a href="/book/show/1331484.The_Backroom_Boys_The_Secret_Return_of_the_British_Boffin" title="The Backroom Boys  The Secret Return of the British Boffin by Francis Spufford">The Backroom Boys</a> to take <a href="/book/show/185829.The_Execution_Channel" title="The Execution Channel by Ken MacLeod">The Execution Channel</a> on a trip.<br />
<br />Surprisingly good.  I&#8217;m often surprised by <a href="/author/show/108281.Ken_MacLeod" title="Ken MacLeod">Ken MacLeod</a> &#8211; he writes clearly, wittingly and sometimes irritatingly Scottish.  His irritations also sometimes roll over into technology (like his erstwhile peer <a href="/author/show/8794.Charles_Stross" title="Charles Stross">Charles Stross</a>) in this book but he mostly keeps it in check.<br />
<br />An alternate &#8220;now/future&#8221; book, not pleasant to the Americans at all and very correctly and righteously frustrated at the injustices of the &#8220;current/real&#8221; world at large. A spy thriller in many ways, with many unsavoury detail it sucks you in completely to the CIA, MI5, DGSE.  A little overly complicated and confusing in the end; bluff, double-bluff, insinuation, mis-information and blow-your-mind-scifi keeps it from 4 star. It&#8217;s premise of disinformation worked against it a little in the end, or maybe that was the whole point.   I&#8217;d read it again except for the fact the airport thriller nature of it is one of the pleasures it imbued.<br />
<br />Sometime in the last few years, Ken has become one of the current leading lights of contemporary Sci-fi.  </p>

<p>I shall spare you the other email comments I’ve received, except this one, from a gentleman in Scotland: “Sadly the word ‘whiskey’ conjures up a very different brew here in Scotland. Scotch Whisky it has ever been, and ‘Scotch Whiskey’ an embarrassing solecism unworthy of The New York Times.’’</p>
