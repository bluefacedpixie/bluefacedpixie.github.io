								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>..on the shores of the far side of the 2000 decade.</p>
<p>A decade review  seems to be an invitation for lists; I will try to keep it short and sweet.</p>
<p>It seems strange that so much focus was placed on the end of the millennium (Y2K, phew), when the last ten years have been so full for me and so much has happened in the world.  I was in transition in 1999 as I waited for a visa to come through to let me work for an internet company in Seattle (even as the dot bomb began&#8230;), and little did I know the tradition of <a href="http://dht240.wordpress.com/2009/12/30/on-reaching-the-end-of-the-decade/">heading off for New Year&#8217;s Eve with friends</a> would be drawing to a close.</p>
<p>This year doesn&#8217;t seem that different from the last in terms of &#8220;closing out&#8221;, but decades make a nice number to chunk time by.  I&#8217;ve had the childhood decade, the teenage years, the &#8220;being adult in Scotland&#8221; decade and now&#8230; the last ten years:</p>
<p>* moving to the USA to work (and now living here on a more permanent basis)<br />
* destroying my accent<br />
* starting most sentences with &#8220;So&#8230;&#8221;<br />
* having an original iPod (deceased)<br />
* and an original iPhone (still working)<br />
* publishing random bits of stuff on the internet in a blog-thing&#8230;<br />
* taking a small trip around the world with a girl<br />
* &#8230;and marrying her&#8230;<br />
* &#8230;and becoming a family of four</p>
<p>So while this decade ends in diapers,  the next decade is going to involve a lot of homework, school runs and play.</p>
<p>See you on the other side.</p>
<p>Happy New Year.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s that time again&#8230;.  tomorrow is the <a href="http://www.ragnarrelay.com/northwestpassage/index.php">Northwest Ragnar</a>.<br />
This year I have convinced <a href="http://machaggis.net/planetdanika/index.php/2008/07/24/ragnar-baby/">D to run it with me</a>!  And in a spate of craziness we are also doing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultramarathon">Ultra</a> &#8211; twice as much running and half as much support in the car (1 driver, 1 support, 1 runner &#8211; in the regular team there are another three folks per van).<br />
I&#8217;m a sorry tale of minor ailments, which I&#8217;m sure is normal prior to such a major event, so here&#8217;s hoping.<br />
Unlike D, this is my first ULTRA-anything running (as in more than 1 marathon&#8217;s running, even if its in a relay).  I&#8217;ll try and post in 29+ miles or so.<br />
(<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/machaggis/sets/72157601093156609/">Here are last year&#8217;s photos</a>, and the relevant post: <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2007/07/29/run-drive-sleep-repeat/">&#8220;Run. Drive. Sleep. Repeat.&#8221;</a>.)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lucy has these little things call BabyLegs.  We keep getting them for free, but D assures me that they are trendy and they cost a lot of money.   So it would appear in a <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/retailreport/2004249884_retailreport29.html">rags to riches story in Seattle Times today</a> about the creator who took a cheap idea and is making big.  Although the origins are murky:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t recommend this, but I found a manufacturer in China on the Internet,&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, the truth is&#8230;. BabyLegs are just little legwarmers.  Sorry.  But with the thought of legwarmers I give you <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=tNdJzrh5AsU">this memory</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and the black and white things peeking in <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/machaggis/2045462523/">this photo</a> &#8211; that&#8217;s BabyLegs.</p>

<p>Considering I&#8217;m a new father, et al, I won&#8217;t elaborate on how many hours I&#8217;ve wasted today trying to get a rather geeky cool idea to work in terms of &#8220;introducing&#8221; Lucy with a little movie title sequence.  Rather than, for example, sleeping when the baby is sleeping etc&#8230;<br />
The <a href="http://alienryderflex.com/crawl/">Star Wars TSG</a> program works fine (almost fast on the MacBook Pro) but it left me with 2817 still frame files that I singularly failed to manage (in my change-diaper, do chores, interrupt-driven manner) to do anything constructive with.  Multiple attempts at iMovie (on a couple of computers) could not convince it to display frames at 25fps, and multiple attempts to export as a movie from iPhoto or import it as a iMovie slideshow all failed.  The best iPhoto effort is a somewhat amusing slow-motion 45-minute sequence &#8211; the best iMovie equivalent is almost 8 hours long (glacial!).  I did work out how to do it in iMovie, but it involved changing the time for each of the 2817 frames by hand (no bulk update) so I avoided that.<br />
Maybe after this is posted someone will have produced an easy guide for how turn the frames into a movie on a Mac with no disk space, so that I can google it when I have time.  Such as when Lucy is three.</p>
