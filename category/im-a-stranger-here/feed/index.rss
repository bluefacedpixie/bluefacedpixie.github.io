								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_So-Called_Life">My So Called Life</a> on <a href="http://www.hulu.com/my-so-called-life">Hulu</a> for the last few nights.  I randomly stumbled across it from a blog post that mentioned it was available and that it featured <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000132/">Claire Danes</a>.  Who isn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005466/">Julia</a> but is a reason to at least give it a try.  And this show is set in 1994, with 15-year olds.  <strike>Which is/was more or less me (but in Kilsyth Academy). </strike> </p>
<p>I&#8217;m a sucker for these shows (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawson%27s_Creek">Dawson&#8217;s Creek</a> anyone?) about self-aware teens in the US education system and TV environments.  And mostly all the shows are like most TV, a waste of time.  But the non-parallels are learning lessons.  I wasn&#8217;t self-aware.  I wasn&#8217;t an American teen.  I wasn&#8217;t in the US system (is it really like that?).  To say nothing of the melodramatic angst etc.  And I don&#8217;t have a monologue in my head.</p>
<p>This show, particularly, is just rife with lessons for Dads with daughters if they grow up like American stereotypes.  To say I&#8217;m afraid would be an understatement.  To say I&#8217;m prepared would be untrue.</p>
<p>Tonight, the little sister wanted to be like big sister while at the same time not wanting to be.  How do you deal with that?  Learning through television&#8230; if there are two girls it might be relevant.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> Well duh, it seems like I&#8217;m getting old &#8211; 1994 != 1984.  After a few episodes the music gave it away.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How about &#8220;I only exist with $20 notes in my pocket&#8221;.</p>
<p>Or &#8220;your spiritual well-being is directly related to the stinkiness of your farts, please pay $10,000 dollars for a course on beef, egg and bean consumption&#8221;.</p>
<p>Or, how about, &#8220;I live on air, except when I eat cheeseburgers&#8221;.  Oh, this one&#8217;s real (?).  See <a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/06/breatharians">Breatharians</a> at <a href="http://www.kottke.org/">kottke.org</a>, but as no-one of importance reads my blog here&#8217;s a full quote of his article&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inedia#Wiley_Brooks">wikipedia</a> quote to whet your appetite:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wiley Brooks is a purported breatharian, and founder of the &#8220;Breatharian Institute of America&#8221;. He was first introduced to the public in 1980, when he appeared on the TV show That&#8217;s Incredible!. Wiley has stopped teaching in recent years, so he can &#8220;devote 100% of his time on solving the problem as to why he needed to eat some type of food to keep his physical body alive and allow his light body to manifest completely.&#8221; Wiley Brooks believes that he has found &#8220;four major deterrents&#8221; which prevented him from living without food: &#8220;people pollution&#8221;, &#8220;food pollution&#8221;, &#8220;air pollution&#8221; and &#8220;electro pollution&#8221;. In 1983 he was allegedly observed leaving a Santa Cruz 7-Eleven with a Slurpee, hot dog and Twinkies.
</p>
<p>He told Colors magazine in 2003 that he periodically breaks his fasting with a cheeseburger and a cola, explaining that when he&#8217;s surrounded by junk culture and junk food, consuming them adds balance. On his website, Brooks explains that his future followers must first prepare by combining the junk food diet with the meditative incantation of five magic &#8220;fifth-dimensional&#8221; words which appear on his website. In the &#8220;Question and Answer&#8221; section of his website, Brooks explains that the &#8220;Double Quarter-Pounder with Cheese&#8221; meal from McDonald&#8217;s possesses a special &#8220;base frequency&#8221; and that he thus recommends it as occasional food for beginning breatharians. He then goes on to reveal that the secret of Diet Coke is &#8220;liquid light&#8221;. Prospective disciples are asked after some time on this junk food/magic word preparation to revisit his website in order to test if they can feel the magic.
</p>
<p>He further mentions that those interested can call him on his fifth-dimensional phone number in order to get the correct pronunciation of the five magic words. In case the line is busy, prospective recruits are asked to meditate on the five magic words for a few minutes, and then try calling again; he does not explain how anyone can meditate with words they cannot yet pronounce. Brooks&#8217;s &#8220;institute&#8221;, in the past, charged varying fees to prospective clients who wished to learn how to live without food, which ranged from US$15 million to $25 million. These charges have historically been presented as limited time offers exclusively for billionaires, New lower fees have been set to $10,000 with an initial deposit of $2,000.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>12th February 1809.</p>
<p>I meant to post something about this a few weeks ago, when the world was celebrating the 200th birthday of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Darwin</a>, and the US was somewhat celebrating that <b>and</b> the 200th birthday of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln">Abe</a> (now <i>that&#8217;s</i> a co-incidence, even if Newsweek thinks its a <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/143742">footnote</a>).</p>
<p>There are a few things I don&#8217;t understand about the US, even as I draw towards being here for a decade.   And this one stumps me.  Europe, with it&#8217;s history of blood, religion and persecution, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_support_for_evolution#Support_for_evolution_by_religious_bodies">accepts the science</a> and reconciles itself to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=life+on+earth+evolution">Evolution</a> (ok, there may be some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_evolutionary_thought">mistakes and fakes</a>, but whatever&#8230;).  America, the country that is so scientific it has <i>sent people to the moon</i>, <i>split the atom</i>, <strike><i>cured cancer</i></strike>, <b>doesn&#8217;t</b>.  And some States don&#8217;t  want to teach it, or also want to teach it with &#8220;Intelligent Design&#8221; etc.  Although changes are being made there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A federal judge has ruled that intelligent design is a religious view that does not belong in a science classroom. The ruling comes as school boards and legislatures across the country debate how to teach students about the origins of life on Earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the Darwin reflections turn, once more, into <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5014428">debate</a>.</p>
<p>I consider this state of affairs a Very American Peculiarity.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn&#8217;t blog this Atlantic article originally, but it keeps coming up in conversation.  <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/print/200811/airport-security">Read how a journalist</a> deliberately and repeatedly repeats <i>every airport security violation</i> he can.  Except without being a real terrorist of course.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On another occasion, at LaGuardia, in New York, the transportation-security officer in charge of my secondary screening emptied my carry-on bag of nearly everything it contained, including a yellow, three-foot-by-four-foot Hezbollah flag, purchased at a Hezbollah gift shop in south Lebanon. The flag features, as its charming main image, an upraised fist clutching an AK-47 automatic rifle. Atop the rifle is a line of Arabic writing that reads Then surely the party of God are they who will be triumphant. The officer took the flag and spread it out on the inspection table. She finished her inspection, gave me back my flag, and told me I could go. I said, Thats a Hezbollah flag. She said, Uh-huh. Not Uh-huh, Ive been trained to recognize the symbols of anti-American terror groups, but after careful inspection of your physical person, your behavior, and your last name, Ive come to the conclusion that you are not a Bekaa Valleytrained threat to the United States commercial aviation system, but Uh-huh, Im going on break, why are you talking to me?
