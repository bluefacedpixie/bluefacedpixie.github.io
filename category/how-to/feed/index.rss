								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.macgeekery.com/tips/security/basic_mac_os_x_security">Pretty good article</a> that&#8217;s simpler and not too far off my own process.</p>
<p>If you are buying or setting up a new Mac, go for it.</p>
<p>If you read the comments the whole &#8220;administrator&#8221; account is explained in a confusing way.  Basically you should have two accounts: your everyday account and an administrator account &#8211; often called <b>admin</b>.  How to set this up depends on whether you&#8217;ve had your computer for a while.</p>
<p><b>If you have a new computer</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Name the default user &#8216;admin&#8217;, leave this user as the administrator.</li>
<li>Make a new &#8220;standard&#8221; user &#8211; that&#8217;s you (my account is called <i>gordon</i>)</li>
<li>Use the standard account.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>If you&#8217;ve used your computer for some time</b></p>
<ol>
<li>There is a good chance this user (your default user) has all your files and stuff, so you want to keep it as your everyday account &#8211; this user is also an admin so you need to do a shell-game to fix this</li>
<li>Create a new admin user &#8211; &#8216;admin&#8217;.</li>
<li>Logout of your normal account</li>
<li>Login, just this once, into your &#8216;admin&#8217; account</li>
<li>Now change your old account (the everyday one) to be &#8220;standard&#8221;. i.e. <b>take the administrator rights away</b>.</li>
<li>Logout of admin.</li>
<li>Log back into your everyday account</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Once you&#8217;ve done this&#8230;</b></p>
<p>You never need to log into the admin account again.  Use your standard account <b>for everything</b>.  The only time you need to know about admin is when software asks you to authenticate &#8211; at that time you need to enter the username (admin) and the password (you did set a good password, right?).  This is a good time for you to think about whether you trust that software, or want to install it etc.</p>
<p><b>Caveat</b></p>
<p>If you know all this then you probably don&#8217;t need to follow any of these hints.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of those little hacks you forget about and wish you had written down.</p>
<p>D &#038; I watch DVDs on our laptops &#8211; normally the Powerbook because the screen&#8217;s bigger.  Of course, the Powerbook has been stolen and the insurance company have blessed me with a MacBook Pro.  And an old problem returned &#8211; we watch our DVDs with sound from our hi-fi using the audio out jack, and the sound is <i>all over the place!</i>.  Loud, quiet, left channel, right channel.</p>
<p>We both vaguely remember having this problem with the Powerbook, but it takes me to the middle of King Kong (<b>3/5</b>) &#8211; which is the third DVD or so we&#8217;ve suffered through &#8211; to remember to go to DVD Player, Preferences and disable something along the lines of <i>attempt to badly simulate Dolby Sorround Sound</i>.  You then have to exit DVD Player and launch it again.</p>
<p>Works now &#8211; a damn fine tip, and I&#8217;m sure I found it on the internet once, long, long ago.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have Amazon Prime &#8211; an $80 a year addiction that allows most Amazon things to be sent to you with 2-day shipping without paying for the shipping (&#8216;coz you&#8217;ve paid $80 for the privilege).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure it costs Amazon money because Danika and I regularly buy <i>any crap</i> we think of so we don&#8217;t have to go into the real world and shop.  We also buy soo many presents and ship them 2-day because that way they get there for the event &#8211; rather than the cheapskate free shipping offer we used to use which had a 3-9 day delivery window.  Amazon hopes to make money on the loyalty and all the profit on the items purchased.</p>
<p>So what?  Well the problem is that Prime only works on Amazon items and Amazon sells their own items and other people&#8217;s and they don&#8217;t apply.  Because Amazon search sucks (a well accepted fact) you can&#8217;t use Amazon to find items that can only be shipped by Prime.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the heart of the matter.  Due to the wonders of the internet and webservices, some kind soul brings us: the <a href="http://www.bigscreenprices.com/amazonprime.html">Amazon.com Prime Items Finder</a>.  It really needs a better name &#8211; like <i>Heaven Sent</i>.  </p>
<p>I am a little suspicious the kind soul may be sticking his associate tags on the clickthroughs though &#8211; I would.</p>
<p>Oh, kaching, I think I&#8217;ve just spent more money at Amazon.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a sad Mac fan, but I&#8217;ve a pretty aggressive hate/love with some of the &#8220;easy to use&#8221; applications that come with the Mac &#8211; such as iTunes.<br />
Finally though, <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/">iTunes 7</a> was released this week and allows me to set an album as &#8220;gapless&#8221;.   What does this mean?  It means that between songs on an album it will neither give a little 1 second gap or crossfade one song into another (ala cheesy radio). Instead there will be a continuous flow of perfect music.<br />
My old concept album-loving self is so happy.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/FB00005QK3B/belufacedpixi-20">Misplaced Childhood</a> is perfect once more.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I discovered HDR last week.</p>
<div class="imgcenter"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/machaggis/209853110/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/88/209853110_2da3e9177a.jpg" width="400"  alt="Mt. Baker (HDR H&#038;S Auto)" /></a></div>
<p>HDR is *High Dynamic Range* photographs.  There are many flickr <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/hdr/">groups</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=HDR&#038;w=all">images</a>, a wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging">entry</a>, an <a href="http://www.hdrsoft.com/resources/dri.html">FAQ</a>, and a recent NYT <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/03/technology/03basics.html?ex=1155268800&#038;en=8533534661f6d724&#038;ei=5070&#038;emc=eta1">article</a>.  All of which happened nigh simultaneously to me last week.</p>
<p>HDR is intriguing &#8211; it offers the ability of combining digital images to expand the range that can be viewed.   This is important as the human eye is more subtle in its distinction of light and detail and can see more in a glance than a photograph can reproduce &#8211; the classic example is viewing a house with an open door.  The human eye will see some detail through the door and the detail of the house, even in bright light.  A photograph would have to choose, as it would not have the _range_ to do both.  The photographer, camera and &#8216;film&#8217; choose the image.  Ironically enough, although digital has a smaller range than film had, it can capture images that can be merged into a greater range than film.  Almost as good as the eye.</p>
<p>The photos taken can be unsettling &#8211; not really photograph like, and often compared to paintings.  We&#8217;re just not used to seeing photos with this many &#8220;shades of gray&#8221; i.e. ranges of colour.   Indeed sometimes the simple photo seems better.</p>
<p>This weekend, while hiking in the North Cascades, I decided to take one set of photographs of Mt. Baker to experiment.   You have to buy HDR merging software; there are plugins for Photoshop (which I don&#8217;t have) and standalone programs e.g. there is one for Windows and Mac called <a href="http://www.hdrsoft.com/">Photomatix</a>.  I used the demo version of Photomatix for experimentation and will probably bite the bullet to produce more HDR photos.</p>
<p>For the example I took 3 shots using exposure bracketing on my Nikon D50, 2 stops apart (one very bright, one ok, one very dark).  All shots were taken with the 18-55mm lens, using a polarizing circular filter on the same position.  I took the shots in NEF (Nikon RAW) but used Preview on the Mac to make them TIFF as Photomatix doesn&#8217;t understand NEF.  I then proceeded to HDR merge the shots in four different ways, choosing values mostly at random and making gratuitous use of automatic settings.</p>
<p>Before we leap into the examples, one final comment: apparently the computer screen doesn&#8217;t necessarily do HDR full justice and you need to print for the full effect.  I&#8217;ll do that later.</p>
<p>*A typical JPG shot*</p>
<div class="imgcenter"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/machaggis/208716750/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/98/208716750_6367890f00.jpg" width="400" alt="6th Aug 06: Mt Baker from Rainbow Ridge" /></a></div>
<p>Now I think the above shot is cracking.  Great colour, nice interaction, good rich feeling.  There&#8217;s a little detail lost in the foreground and clouds, but I&#8217;m not looking there.</p>
<p>*My first HDR &#8211; a straight automatic average merge*</p>
<div class="imgcenter"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/machaggis/209853388/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/62/209853388_68ecdd31f6.jpg" width="400" alt="Mt. Baker (HDR Averaged)" /></a></div>
<p>Wow.  Admittedly, for the HDR&#8217;s I&#8217;ve zoomed out a little from the JPG, but the trees are so green.  But the sky is a little wishy-washy, not really as deep as the JPG.  But wait, there&#8217;s detail in the cloud.  And if I take my Smith&#8217;s off, what do I _really_ see.</p>
<p>*HDR &#8211; Tonemapped*</p>
<div class="imgcenter"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/machaggis/209853241/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/79/209853241_272760fd88.jpg" width="400" alt="Mt. Baker (HDR Tonemapped)" /></a></div>
<p>An alterative merging process, I don&#8217;t think this is the best shot to play with.  Too bright, but that _unrealistic_ watercolour effect that people complain about is creeping in.</p>
<p>*HDR &#8211; Automatic Mode*</p>
<p>This shot is the one used at the head of the blog entry.</p>
<div class="imgcenter"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/machaggis/209853110/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/88/209853110_2da3e9177a.jpg" width="400" alt="Mt. Baker (HDR H&#038;S Auto)" /></a></div>
<p>Once the colour difference with the JPG is accepted, the detail is amazing.  This is the same camera.  It&#8217;s only 6MP, the detail differences can&#8217;t be explained with JPG/NEF because it&#8217;s mostly about colour.  I am now officially intrigued.</p>
<p>*HDR &#8211; Manual Adjustment*</p>
<div class="imgcenter"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/machaggis/209852963/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/76/209852963_cf140d5357.jpg" width="400" alt="Mt. Baker (HDR H&#038;S Adjust)" /></a></div>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing with the manual settings.  There are a lot of sliders and settings.  My objective was to find a midpoint between *tone* and *auto* and I kinda like it.  I think that for this mode, you need a vision and then try and get there with digital merging.</p>
<p>*and now&#8230;*</p>
<p>To wrap up, what do you think &#8211; which one looks best, the most realistic?  I&#8217;m a far shot from this flickr group, which claims to be <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/myfirsthdr/">My First HDR</a>. Leave comments here, or on flickr.  In my geeky way, I&#8217;ll be watching.</p>
<p>_[Photomatix branding on some presented images due to demo software.  Good, easy to use, runs well but not sparky on my older Powerbook G4 on 35Mb images]_</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Instructions I&#8217;ve been sharing for the bloggers on machaggis.net and aphotoperday. <span id="more-215"></span></p>
<p>I used to host all the photos on <a href="http://bluefacedpixie.com">bluefacedpixie</a> etc on the<a href="http://machaggis.net"> machaggis.net</a> website.  With the start of <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/category/photos/a-photo-per-day/">aphotoperday</a> this started to get on heavy on my small network storage at <a href="http://luxsci.com/affiliate.php/la-129074/index.html">luxsci</a> so I started to post them to <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> (the rest of the world seems to do this) and then cross-post them from flickr to my blog.  Technically this is called <i>hosting</i> the images on flickr and <i>including</i> or <i>referring</i> to them  on the blog.</p>
<p>As a few people use my blogs, and as I warm Phillipa and Cindy up for aphotperday, these are the instructions I&#8217;ve been sharing.</p>
<p><b>Posting to flickr</b></p>
<ol>
<li>go to <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> and choose sign up now if you don&#8217;t already have a login
<ul>
<li>sign up for a yahoo id &#8211; follow the instructions, use a real email address &#8211; this includes checking your email and clicking on a link back to yahoo
</li>
<li>go back to flickr
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>sign in to flickr (i.e. with your yahoo id and password)
<ul>
<li>if its the first time, set up your account with your nickname etc
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>click on upload to upload pictures
<ul>
<li>n.b. I also clicked on upload tools and installed a program to my computer to make this easier &#8211; both the Mac and Windows Flickr Uploaders work, and the iPhoto Export to Flickr works too.
</li>
<li>Upload the pictures with the &#8220;resize to 800&#8221; option so that you do not use all your bandwidth per month.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Posting to your blog from flickr</b></p>
<p>These instructions talk specifically about some bluefacedpixie and machaggis.net and wordpress settings, hopefully you get the idea.</p>
<ol>
<li>goto http://www.flickr.com/blogs.gne
</li>
<li>setup a new blog to post to from flickr (many instructions follow):
<ul>
<li>wordpress (then next)

<li>delete ALL the text

</li>
<li>n.b. the blog will post to the default <i>category</i> on the wordpress blog (for bluefacedpixie this is <i>random</i>) so you may want to immediately edit the post and change it&#8217;s category (e.g. I do this to quickly change the category to <i><a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/category/photos/a-photo-per-day/">A Photo Per Day</a></i> and any other relevant sub-categories).

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Installing JBlogEditor 0.6 on Tiger.</p>
<p><span id="more-99"></span></p>
<p>After trying ecto and MarsEdit I thought I would give the experimental build of the all-Java JBlogEditor a spin.  It was a little more complicated that I thought it would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the tar from <a href="http://www.javio.com/JBlogEditor/">http://www.javio.com/JBlogEditor/</a>
</li>
<li>Untar it (by doubleclicking in Finder) &#8211; this creates a jblogger directory.
</li>
<li>Edit the file jblogger/macosx.carbon.ppc/configuration/config.ini: find the reference to <code>org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86</code> and carefully change it to <code>org.eclipse.swt.carbon.macosx.ppc</code> (this fixes a bug in the default download)
</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t already have it, download and install Java 1.5 from Apple: <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/java2se50release3.html">Java 2 SE 5</a>.  Tiger defaults to Java 1.4.2 for maximum compatibility.
</li>
<li>As I can&#8217;t work out how to configure the application to automatically choose Java 1.5 (please add a comment if you know how) I then have to run the application from Terminal:
<ul>
<li>change to the jblogger/macosx.carbon.ppc directory (for me that&#8217;s <code>cd ~/Incoming/jblogger/macosx.carbon.ppc</code>)
</li>
<li>set the PATH variable to prefer Java 1.5 and then execute the editor using open: <code>export PATH=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.5/Commands/:${PATH};  open -a jblogeditor.app</code>.  (This is all on one line and may vary a little depending on your shell).
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>JBlogEditor should now start and ask for configuration for your blog &#8211; it&#8217;s still early verion 0.6.0 but unlike other applications it is cross-platform and free.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately after all the effort it looks pretty dull and I still like editing my posts in Mail or the WordPress editor!</p>

<p>You are reading this article.  Maybe you visit occasionally, or only when someone (such as myself) emails you.  Maybe there are several blogs that are fun but you only look at occasionally because it&#8217;s too much trouble to check them everyday and there is only sometimes something new.  RSS is the solution to this problem.</p>
<p>This technical _HowTo_ will give some guidelines on using RSS &#8211; just click on more.</p>
<p><span id="more-38"></span></p>
<p>RSS (sometimes called feeds) is syndication &#8211; like the <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/">Dilbert</a> cartoon in the newspapers &#8211; only one newspaper/website has the original but many other newspapers/websites can pick it up.  It&#8217;s an ugly way to explain something simple.</p>
<p>The idea is that you _subscribe_ to an RSS feed from another program and check that program *once* (or more) daily.  This program watches all the other websites for you and tells you when they changed &#8211; when there is a new <a href="feed:http://www.tapestrycomics.com/dilbert.xml">Dilbert</a> to look at for instance.</p>
<p>The programs you can use can be special RSS programs (like <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>), the browser you use (like <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a>) or a website that manages RSS feeds.  I like this last approach (I use <a href="http://bloglines.com">bloglines.com</a>) because then I can access this list from work, home and any computer I happen to use that is connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>Basically &#8211; you should do this, life is too short to visit 100 blogs (or even 3) every day.  So here is the How-To, in short Gordon style:</p>
<ol>
<li>Somewhere on your screen either your browser is showing a big cheery *RSS* symbol (e.g. at the end of the address bar in Safari) or an obscure radio logo (in the bottom right hand side of Firefox) or on the page itself it says &#8220;RSS&#8221;.  For fun sometimes a cool RSS graphic is displayed, but these always vary (although they are normally orange or blue) and sometimes even say &#8220;XML&#8221; &#8211; confused?
<ul>
<li>On the <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/">bluefacedpixie</a> using the bfp theme the RSS feeds are in the bottom right of the column in the _Geek_ section: <a href="feed:http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/?feed=rss2">Entries (RSS)</a> &#8211; for RSS on the main posts &#8211; and <a href="feed:http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/?feed=comments-rss2">Comments (RSS)</a> &#8211; for RSS on the comments people post to the posts.
</li>
<li>On <a href="http://machaggis.net/planetdanika/">planetdanika</a> using the Blue Horizon theme the <a href="feed:http://machaggis.net/planetdanika/?feed=rss2">RSS feed</a> for the posts is on the bottom of the page (called RSS).
</li>
<li>For <a href="http://machaggis.net/premodernist/">premodernist</a> the RSS links are also at the bottom and are for <a href="feed:http://machaggis.net/premodernist/?feed=rss2">Entries</a> and <a href="feed:http://machaggis.net/premodernist/?feed=comments-rss2">Comments</a> (like bluefacedpixie).
</li>
<li>On <a href="http://hellionwarden.blogspot.com/">hellion</a> (which isn&#8217;t a machaggis.net blog) there isn&#8217;t an explicit RSS link, but Safari and Firefox show *RSS* logos showing they found a <a href="feed://hellionwarden.blogspot.com/atom.xml">feed</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The feed is just like an internet link.  It looks something like this: <a href="feed:http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/?feed=rss2">feed:http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/?feed=rss2</a> or this: <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/?feed=rss2http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/?feed=rss2">http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/?feed=rss2</a>.
</li>
<li>Add the link to an RSS reader &#8211; I use <a href="http://bloglines.com">bloglines.com</a> but <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">reader.google.com</a> has some promise.
<ul>
<li>You generally do this by:
<ul>
<li>right clicking on the RSS symbol/text and choosing _copy this link_ (your wording may vary).
</li>
<li>going to the website and &#8220;subscribing&#8221; to the link you have copied (paste it in)
</li>
<li>if the link starts with *feed:* then sometimes you have to delete it &#8211; its a speed of technology thing
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is, however, better if there is a special link like this: <img src="http://www.bloglines.com/images/sub_modern5.gif" border="0" alt="Subscribe with Bloglines" /> which generally does all this work for you (for bloglines at least).  I&#8217;ve added one to bluefacedpixie and will add them to the other blogs in time.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(<i>Alternative</i>: Just to click on the RSS link and then add it to your bookmarks &#8211; if you use Safari or Firefox then these work as basic RSS readers for you and will check these _live bookmarks_ regularly)
</li>
<li>And surprisingly, that&#8217;s it.  Go to your reader and look at your list of blogs.  On a regular basis it will show a new post from the website you are interested in and you can read it or click through to see the whole text.
</li>
</ol>
<p>And it isn&#8217;t restricted to just personal blogs &#8211; RSS was originally intended to distribute news headlines so <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/rss">http://www.nytimes.com/rss</a> is the feed for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> for instance (the orange XML at the bottom of the main page).</p>
<p>More info:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(protocol)">wikipedia&#8217;s RSS entry</a>  is a little more tech than this, but gives examples of the icons
</li>
<li><a href="http://blogspace.com/rss/readers">blogspace</a> has a nice RSS description page
</li>
<li>the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/">Safari RSS</a> description
</li>
<li>and then there is always the <a href="http://a9.com/">A9</a>/<a href="http://google.com">google</a> <a href="http://a9.com/?q=RSS">search results</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Have fun with RSS!</p>
