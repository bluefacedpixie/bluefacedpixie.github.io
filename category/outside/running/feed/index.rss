<p>That&#8217;s currently the unofficial time of team 95 (&#8220;Ultra Crawlers&#8221;) at the Ragnar.<br />
Our team of amateur, we-really-shouldn&#8217;t-be-here, Ultra runners cranked home an impressive run.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/machaggis/sets/72157606389855178/">Here are a few photos</a> (I&#8217;ll add to the album later).<br />
Some of my more personal stats:<br />
Hours slept: 3<br />
Leg 1 pace: 7:50 min/mile<br />
Leg 2 pace: 8:00 min/mile<br />
Leg 3 pace: 8:20 min/mile<br />
I do have mostly more accurate stats from a Forerunner 405 I was wearing but it&#8217;s mostly undue accuracy and also for Leg 1 the timer didn&#8217;t stop <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
I may post more details, I&#8217;m sure D will, but for now, I AM NOW AN ULTRA RUNNER.  Ragnar NW 08 is over. And I am going to finish this glass of wine and go to bed.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s that time again&#8230;.  tomorrow is the <a href="http://www.ragnarrelay.com/northwestpassage/index.php">Northwest Ragnar</a>.<br />
This year I have convinced <a href="http://machaggis.net/planetdanika/index.php/2008/07/24/ragnar-baby/">D to run it with me</a>!  And in a spate of craziness we are also doing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultramarathon">Ultra</a> &#8211; twice as much running and half as much support in the car (1 driver, 1 support, 1 runner &#8211; in the regular team there are another three folks per van).<br />
I&#8217;m a sorry tale of minor ailments, which I&#8217;m sure is normal prior to such a major event, so here&#8217;s hoping.<br />
Unlike D, this is my first ULTRA-anything running (as in more than 1 marathon&#8217;s running, even if its in a relay).  I&#8217;ll try and post in 29+ miles or so.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My fourth <a href="http://www.seafairmarathon.com/">Seafair half-marathon</a>!</p>
<p>This year there was a new course &#8211; more interesting, but harder.   We ran one-way from UW to Bellevue &#8211; going over the 520 bridge, which was great fun.  There were more hills and less dullness than the old Bellevue-centric route, but we also had a hot day &#8211; starting about 70&deg; at 7.15 am!</p>
<p>My time(*) was down from the last few year (1 hour, 46 minutes, 18 seconds) including a (now regular) unscheduled pit stop &#8211; but with the new route and the hot, hot, heat I&#8217;m happy.</p>
<p>Danika did the full marathon in 4 hours 13 minutes &#8211; fabulous!  I kept her company for the first 200 yards and the last 1/2 mile.</p>
<p>Results so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>10-Jul-05 Seafair Half Marathon 1:48:02</li>
<li>9-Jul-06 Seafair Half Marathon 1:42:40</li>
<li>8-Jul-07 Seafair Half Marathon 1:42:38</li>
<li>29-Jun-08 Seafair Half Marathon 1:46:18</li>
</ul>
<p>Danika tells me I was 180th out of over 1000 men doing the half-marathon and 36th out of 186 in my age group <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>(*) Interestingly enough the <a href="http://www.athleteslounge.com/results/event/2253/results.php?bib=4449&#038;p=&#038;ag=&#038;oa=M">official results page</a> this year posts finish times based on clock time and not on the little chip we pay for and run with &#8211; but give the 2 mins 25 second delay in crossing the start line.  So I took that off.  That&#8217;s the whole point of chip times &#8211; it stops people from fighting to cross the start line first &#8211; we leave that to the Kenyans and fast folk (like <a href="http://www.athleteslounge.com/results/event/2253/results.php?bib=7&#038;p=&#038;ag=&#038;oa=M">Edward Kiptum</a> who ran the marathon in 2 hours 20 minutes 28 seconds).</p>

<p>During barefoot running, the ball of the foot strikes the ground first and immediately starts sending signals to the spinal cord and brain about the magnitude of impact and shear, getting most of its clues about this from the skin contact with the surface irregularities of the ground.  Take away this contact by adding a cushioned substance and you immediately fool the system into underestimating the impact.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In what is now becoming an <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2006/07/10/running-boy/">annual event</a> we trekked over to Bellevue for the <a href="http://seafair.com/">Seafair</a> half-marathon.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d done a reasonable amount of &#8216;ok&#8217; training for it this year, but in the last four weeks combinations of business travel, migraines and pulled muscles had me picturing doom and gloom and images of unmitigated disaster ahead.   But the pessimism was undue and I had a lovely little run in good weather and came in without too many aches and pains at 1 hour, 42 mins, 41 seconds (unofficial) which is just 20 seconds shy of last year, and included an impromptu pit-stop (just like last year!).  In terms of time &#8211;  although I can probably do better  &#8211; this is most respectable.</p>
<p>Of course, the real event was the triumphant return of D, kicking bootÃ© not even 6 months since the whole birth event, strolling in only a few minutes behind.  What a girl, and I&#8217;m sure Rocket Girl is on her way back.</p>
<p>[<i>Update</i>: <a href="http://jeffreypratt.livejournal.com/27017.html">Looks like Jeffrey</a> made his  hours too!]</p>
<p>[<i>Update 2</i>: Official time is 1:42:38, last year official time was 1:42:40 &#8211; so <b>2 seconds faster this year!!!!</b>]</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have a friend, Kristen, who happens to see us about once a week.   Given Danika&#8217;s voyage through pregnancy this means that every week Kristen gets to see real progress as Danika&#8217;s belly develops.  And often comments on mine. Yes, sympathy belly has struck and I&#8217;m running a little lardy these days.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to blame it all on pregnancy and helping Danika eat all that chocolate and ice cream.  But the summer&#8217;s legacy of good meals, vacation, afternoon scones and a re-discovered predilection for beer (as opposed to wine) all take a portion of blame.   The shorter bike commute may also have a part to play.  So this week I started to step up my activities in the hope that I can shed a few pounds and have myself in sporting trim.  Little did I know I was setting myself up for multiple ass-kickings!</p>
<p>On Monday I headed to a &#8220;ski conditioning&#8221; class at the gym that comes with my work.   I never go to the gym, and never really go to class (although I did do Spin Cycling in 2002 before going to Peru) but thoroughly enjoyed myself.  Although it was pretty hard.  And I reckon it must have been effective, because it was Wednesday before I could stand upright without pain and Friday before I could move freely.  Every muscle that ever hurt at the beginning of snowboard season was in full ache, as if I&#8217;d just rode Blackcomb on blacks only as a first ride of the year &#8211; including wipeouts.  I&#8217;m planning to go to class tomorrow again, and then I&#8217;ll decide how much of a masochist I am.</p>
<p>Today, rather than doing a Fiore run I headed out to Cougar to do a little trail run &#8211; it felt like the right Fall thing to do and it had been pretty when Danika and I walked there last weekend.  I managed to kick my own ass very severely, gasping for breath and struggling on anything that had an upward incline.  It was pretty sad &#8211; 15 minutes in I had to have a little &#8216;rest&#8217; (translation: stop on the trail on my haunches as my heart was exploding and my lungs had shrunk to soggy teabags) only for people on the trail past the bend to think that my wheezing was loud enough to be a bear (they did the whole &#8220;clap your hands loudly&#8221; thing!).  I was mortified.   I did persevere and with a few stops ended up running for a little over an hour &#8211; with over 30 minutes of stops.  </p>
<p>This nicely ties up a week of Activities &#8211; I think I may even manage to get in shape if I keep this up &#8211; although it&#8217;s going to hurt.</p>
<p>Mon (2nd): bike to/from work and go to ski conditioning class<br />
Tue: bike to/from work<br />
Wed: bike to/from work<br />
Thu: bike to/from work<br />
Fri: bike to/from work<br />
Sat: nada<br />
Sun: trail run 6 miles/74 minutes at Cougar</p>
<p><i>Update: As a coda to the trail run, I&#8217;ve since spent most of the day eating like a horse, including scones and a whole bag of kettle chips.  At least getting fit isn&#8217;t a diet.</i></p>

<p>A few weeks of preparation paid off in the run yesterday.</p>
<p>I was pretty happy with my time &#8211; over 6 minutes better than the struggle from the year before (although eating gourmet food the night before had been fun).  Surprisingly many of the elements of the run were the same: critical toilet break at first <a href="http://www.honeybucket.com/">Honey Buckets</a>, shin splints at 2-4 miles, a pretty slow first half (working the pacer at 8 min/miles up to the 5-mile mark) and some exceptionally nice running between 7 and 12 miles.</p>
<p>If I could work out how to run the same way as I feel at about 10 miles, I could even have a future in the game.  As it was I got a little worried at hot knees in the last mile, but sneaked it in regarldless, dropping runners for the last few miles, even up to the last .1 (of 13.1) mile stretch.</p>
<p>Before cockiness sets in though, Danika said the tannoy had the first half-marathoner coming in at 1 hour 7 minutes &#8211; that&#8217;s <strike>better than a 5 minute</strike> almost a 4-minute mile.  For 13.1 miles.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we bit off more than expected.  We tried to run Tiger &#8220;3 Summits&#8221;, got slightly lost on the Section Line at the start (the notes never said to run on &#8220;<i>unmaintained trail</i>&#8220;), and then ended up <b>walking up</b> most of the Tiger #3 West Summit (as opposed to East Tiger, where I mountain bike).  Brutal.  Nice run down though.</p>
<p>Today was a rest day.</p>
<p>Mon (24th Apr): bike to/from work<br />
Tue: bike to/from work<br />
Wed: bike to/from work, slightly long route, taking <a href="http://machaggis.net/planetdanika/index.php/2006/04/27/a-bona-fide-bike-commuter/">Danika into work</a> for the first time<br />
Thu: run Fiore (42 mins, walked the hill)<br />
Fri: bike to/from work using Dexter route, with Danika<br />
Sat: Tiger #3 (arbitrary distance, to be determined)<br />
Sun: absolutely nothing, nada, zilch, nano.  Did walk downtown for coffee though.</p>
