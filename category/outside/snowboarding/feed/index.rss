								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It had been a long four-day week of extended days; there had been <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2006/11/30/27th-nov-06-bike-in-snow-i/">a lot of snow</a>; I intended to catch some sleep and do some hours from home.  But reality prevailed and I swapped a Friday for some weekend work, and although all my compadres woosed out I headed to Stevens Pass for a brief snowboarding interlude before parenting arrives.</p>
<p>It was a grand day.  I&#8217;m not big into snowboarding by myself but it was nice, the snow was pretty good (it&#8217;s the 1st of December <a href="http://www.sharpened.net/glossary/acronym.php?FCOL">FCOL</a>) with a good bed, some nice fluffy and flurries during the day.  Many trees and granite rocks were in evidence.  I still have to build up the courage to go down to the basement and check the <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2006/04/12/12th-apr-06-burning-heart/">board</a> for scrapes.  There were a few <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2006/12/01/1st-dec-06-not-groomed/">ungroomed runs</a> which let me play a little, and the groomers were fast.   As I was myself I only played with the trees a little, and didn&#8217;t wear my helmet to remind me not to be silly.  As it was a Friday/weekday it was empty, once I had to wait in line for 30 seconds for a chair.  Indeed the only downside to going on Friday rather than Saturday was that I hit the 520 rush hour traffic on the way back to Seattle which put a drag on the day, but if I had stopped for food that wouldn&#8217;t have happened.</p>
<p>As as I was riding by myself I indulged myself by listening to music all day as there was no one to be social with.  I used my iPod Shuffle (old style) with a random collection flung on after breakfast.  It was pretty good, and I learned that music can be influential while snowboarding and riding the lifts &#8211; *inspirational* (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000WF0/tag2=ballardcorner-20">Bitter Sweet Symphony</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verve">Verve</a>), *motivating* (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006399FS/tag2=ballardcorner-20">Vertigo</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U2">U2</a>) and downright *dangerous* (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000B0WODA/tag2=ballardcorner-20">I&#8217;m Your Villain</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Ferdinand_%28band%29">Franz Ferdinand</a>). </p>
<p>It would be nice to do more snowboarding this season, but I&#8217;m grateful to get out even once, as Noodlehead will <a href="http://machaggis.net/planetdanika/index.php/2006/11/30/the-final-stretch/">soon be here</a>.  And then the fun begins.</p>

I&#8217;ve technically missed a couple of days, but have always had an &#8220;early a.m. the next day&#8221; shot to compensate.  And everyone has suffered &#8220;completion shot&#8221; syndrome such as the <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php?s=bookshelf">books</a> and <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php?s=bookshelf">the signs</a> series.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was lucky this weekend.   My friend Jim called and invited us to go snowboarding.  Danika couldn&#8217;t make it (off learning <a href="http://machaggis.net/planetdanika/index.php/2006/04/09/another-new-sport/">new sports</a>) but I roped Morgan into joining us and we headed to <a href="http://skicrystal.com">Crystal</a> yesterday.   They had received 5&#8243; of spring snow and it was pretty damn fine.  Certainly better than <a href="http://machaggis.net/premodernist/?p=53">gardening</a>.   We spent an extra-ordinary amount of fun time in the <a href="http://skicrystal.com/_DOWNLOADS/CM_Trail-Map_1_600h800w.jpg">Snorting Elk Bowl</a> and also scooting about with Jim and Fidelma.</p>
<p>It&#8217;d rounded out a rather sporadic activity week nicely &#8211; I&#8217;ve had to change my work route due to the closed Elliot Bay Park, so lost a mile per day on the bike as the new route is more direct and less scenic.</p>
<p>Mon (3rd): nada (flying)<br />
Tue: bike to work and have flat tire on way home<br />
Wed: bike to/from work (coming home on Dexter)<br />
Thu: bike to/from work<br />
Fri: nada<br />
Sat: nada<br />
Sun: snowboarding at Crystal</p>
