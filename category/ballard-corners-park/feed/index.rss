But in the big checklist that is our life, the <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org">Ballard Corners Park</a> officially opened last week!  Yeah!  Ok, so its been open and usable all summer so its a bit of an anti-climax but 2 hours of free pizza from our neighbours <a href="http://veracipizza.com">Veraci</a> helped make it special.<br />
Here&#8217;s a cracker of a photo of our girl jumping.  Which competes with &#8220;running around&#8221; as her favourite thing.</p>

<span id="more-703"></span><br />
<a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org">Ballard Corners Park</a> search wasn&#8217;t working after you left the top page &#8211; the redirect for the form post was just wrong.</p>
<p>But I compare the <a href="http://bluefacedpixie.com">bluefacedpixie</a>, <a href="http://planetdanika.com">planetdanika</a> and ballardcornerspark <code>sidebar.php</code> and &#8220;permalinks&#8221; and &#8220;general&#8221; options and all was the same.</p>
<p>Mmmmm.  I&#8217;m not hitting <code>index.php</code>, but the configs are the same.  Is it a &#8220;.org&#8221; conspiracy?  I think not.  The WordPress versions are different &#8211; the Park is the only website on WordPress 2, everything else is on 1.5 (bad, I know, go away).</p>
<p>I added the <code>index.php/</code> to the action on the ballardcornerspark search though, and it all worked.<br />
<code></p>
<form id="searchform" method="get" action="index.php/<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>"><br />
</form>
<p></code></p>
<p>Sweetness, check that box, next bug, it&#8217;s all non-profit time.</p>
<p>Have you <b>bought</b> anything from Amazon via our <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org/shop">site</a> yet?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8230;once more.</p>
<p>For the last couple of weeks I&#8217;ve been making myself unpopular with Danika by geeking out over some volunteer work.</p>
<p>Yes, I ended up being the webmonkey for Ballard Corners Park.  The co-chair had done a stellar job on maintaining a good static site with a basic solid design with FrontPage.  But times moved on and he wanted to get more dynamic so that he didn&#8217;t have to send out so many emails to his emailing lists and also to allow others to contribute.  He wanted a blog.  I obliged, but ended up <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>ing the whole site into WordPress as a CMS and reverse-engineering his FrontPage WYSIWYG into a theme.  And then backing off on a lot of the design because it looked *too much* like the old site, and we wanted something that looked a little newer and <em>blog</em>.</p>
<p>I may have a few geeky stories to tell if I care &#8211; about finding a new email encoder that WordPress could re-post without screwing up, about how using the WordPress 2.0 WYSIWYG editor screws that up *and* seems to blow away <code></p>
<p></code> and <code><br /></code> tags.   But it&#8217;s too late for objective descriptions (and last Monday these descriptions would be have been anything <i>but</i> objective). So&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;please go play at the <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org/ballardcornerspark">BallardCornersPark</a> to be, it&#8217;s going live this weekend so if you see anything broken, want to vomit, or would like to improve it significantly &#8211; use the comments on this post (I&#8217;m expecting none due to readership levels, so don&#8217;t feel bad).  The original site (for now) is at <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org">http://ballardcornerspark.org</a> &#8211; for reference.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve indirectly mentioned Ballard Corners Park before, in <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2006/06/15/15th-june-06-ballard-corners-park/">a photo per day</a> in June.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now time, however, to throw my hat (and heart) in the ring and do the full on &#8220;<em>nothing-comes-for-free-in-America-isn&#8217;t-neighbourhood-fund-raising-a-great-thing</em>&#8221; thing.</p>
<p>I live in Ballard (<a href="http://www.inballard.com/">inballard</a>, <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Seattle/Ballard">wikipedia</a>), it&#8217;s a nice little community but by a freak of its past it&#8217;s short of <i>green spaces</i> i.e. parks.   </p>
<p>A few blocks from our house there are two lots that are being re-purposed for a neighbourhood park under the <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/PARKS/proparks/acquisition.htm">Green Spaces/Pro Parks Levy</a>.  Politics aside, we hope to build (in 2008) a child-friendly park that can act as a locus for the local families.   Ballard is so short of parks that the open area built beside the public library as part of a corporate &#8220;we want to build condos on top of our grocery store&#8221; deal is frequented by <a href="http://machaggis.net/bluefacedpixie/index.php/2006/07/20/20th-july-06-fountain/">children in the summer</a> (ok, the fountains help).</p>
<p>The working title for this project is <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org">Ballard Corners Park</a> and the committee is called <b>Friends of Ballards Corners Park</b>.  More details can be found at the main website at <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org">http://ballardcornerspark.org</a>.  I say the working name of the park is &#8220;Ballard Corners&#8221; only because the final name is decided by the Seattle Parks dept. and will probably be named after a dead councillor&#8217;s wife or Bill Gates&#8217; dog.  But that&#8217;s not really the point.</p>
<p>The park costs upwards of $400,000.  Yup, <b>$400,000</b>.  Not cheap but <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org/images/second%20community%20meeting/1763PreferredPlan.pdf">it looks good</a>.  And a significant portion of the money has to be raised through fund-raising, sponsorship and &#8220;matching&#8221;.</p>
<p>Although not part of the committee I&#8217;ve been helping out in whatever way I can.  Danika and I have attended a few meetings and banked a few volunteer hours.  Danika has planted bulbs in the rain to pretty-up our wasteland lot for the spring.  I&#8217;ve helped out on the pending t-shirts.  And I&#8217;m helping raise money from friends and family by skimming affiliate money for a good cause from internet shopping monsters such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/?%5Fencoding=UTF8&#038;tag=ballardcorner-20&#038;linkCode=sb1">Amazon.com</a>.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re about to shop at Amazon.com to buy Danika a 30th birthday present (hint, hint) or Thanksgiving or the pending holidays.  Don&#8217;t <i>just</i> shop at Amazon.  Shop at Amazon by using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/?%5Fencoding=UTF8&#038;tag=ballardcorner-20&#038;linkCode=sb1">this link</a>, or going to <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org/shop">ballardcornerspark.org/shop</a> (where hopefully over time more than Amazon will be featured), or access the <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/ballardcorner-20">Ballard Corners Park Amazon Store</a>.</p>
<p>This method gives upwards of 4% of revenue to the funds, and you can bet every little helps.  We&#8217;re also working with local companies (such as <a href="http://elephantsgerald.com/">Elephants Gerald</a> for t-shirts) so this represents an ability for non-locals to help the community Danika and I live in.</p>
<p>And you&#8217;re going to see links appear both on <a href="http://bluefacedpixie.com">bluefacedpixie.com</a> and <a href="http://planetdanika.com">planetdanika.com</a> in the near future (once I recover from a Mac wipe that has set me back weeks in terms of technology).    These features use Amazon links to perform magic recommendations that are relevant to <i>you</i>, but we will also use simple &#8220;shop at amazon&#8221; links too:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?%5Fencoding=UTF8&#038;node=1&#038;tag=ballardcorner-20&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325">Photo Books at Amazon.com</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ballardcorner-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>
<p>and search boxes:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=ballardcorner-20&#038;o=1&#038;p=27&#038;l=qs1&#038;f=ifr" width="180" height="150" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>All of these will credit money to our parks project.  You can also make non-profit tax free donations using <a href="http://ballardcornerspark.org/Help_Us/">these instructions</a>.</p>
<p>And finally, if you are an internet/blog user (I&#8217;m looking at <a href="http://hellionwarden.blogspot.com/">hellion</a> and <a href="http://dogcow.org/">dogcow</a> and my readership of 3 here) then add these links to your blogs/websites (sorry for the crappy wrapping and naff formatting):</p>
