					<description><![CDATA[@martin - well it makes it convergent in a way that perhaps the iPhone finally made Smartphones make sense to everyone who wasn&#039;t a corporate-email-Blackberry-junkie - or it&#039;s just another step along the way in that evolution.

I think E-Ink, or a replacement technology (passive, zero power, high contrast) is necessary for large volume electronic reading, but the idea of a dedicated ebook reader in this day and age seems somewhat quaint.

As far as I&#039;m concerned the fact that the Kindle/Amazon books are cheaper is still the killer issue compared to the competition (&lt;b&gt;cough&lt;/b&gt; Sony &lt;b&gt;cough&lt;/b&gt;).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello - long-time reader, first post (on this ID). 

:)

Apologies assumed, I do find it interesting that for many users, the Kindle is a functional web-browser and on-line periodical portal as much as it is an ebook reader. I&#039;m not sure what that makes it convergent with, so to speak.  I suspect that over the next three to five years we&#039;ll see something similar to what happened with MP3 players, where devices with a primary function of reading ebooks will fall to a price point not unlike the iPod nano, and the Kindle approach will converge with netbooks &#038; smartphones (it&#039;ll need robust high-def e-ink tech that can also support video playback, though - maybe that will be the choke point). The current Kindle &#039;contract for life&#039; could easily be emulated with a more short-term mobile carrier deal with either ebook vendors (a cut of cash) or a specific bulk data tarrif to customer - or both!]]></description>
