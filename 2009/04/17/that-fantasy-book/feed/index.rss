					<description><![CDATA[And the first version I read was the 1-volume hardback that my parents had - I can&#039;t even remember what the dust-jacket had on it. I do remember that it eventually fell apart due to over-thumbing, and my brother Steve rebound it as part of a college project. I wonder where it is now?

My own copies are the 1-volume with a still from the film, and the hardbacks with the Alan Lee paintings throughout. I may need to source an e-copy now, though...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s very interesting - I had a quick look over the weekend. And it&#039;s near time for a re-read, so this might be as good a time as any.

I read a piece about the Lord of the Rings recently that rang true - namely, that Tolkien was writing myth (with added narrative detail) rather than an actual narrative-type novel. It puts criticism, and experience of, the book in a fresh perspective, I think. After all, it doesn&#039;t necessarily work as a novel, but as a detailed telling of a mythic story it is now the modern Western archetype. That&#039;s what later fantasy blockbusters have been trying to (and largely failing to) match over the years. 

And yes, he&#039;s a fine writer. People forget he was a teacher of Anglo-Saxon literature as well as philology. And Anglo-Saxon and Norse literature/sagas are hugely rich in alliteration, contrasts of nature and the works of man, repetition, etc.]]></description>
