					<description><![CDATA[Hi Gordon: 

I just wanted to personally invite you to try out 80108 (http://www.80108.com/friends). While we have a handful of local channels in Seattle -- with more on the way! -- I&#039;d recommend weather and Seattle:KidStuff as good starting points. Here&#039;s what we sent out this weekend: 

[Kids] Catch a free jam by local faves Recess Monkey this Sat. at Island Books, and pick up some summer reading while you&#039;re at it. Reply R for more.
Recess: They&#039;re teachers turned kiddie band; their song &quot;Busy Squirrel&quot; sounds just like The Postal Service. Many nods to the Beatles, too. Reply I for info.
The Recess Monkeys @ Island Books, 3014 78th Ave SE, Mercer Island. Sat. 6/9, 11-11:30. Free. Ages 3 and up. 206-232-6920

Check out http://www.80108.com/company/correspondents.php to learn some more about Barb K, our correspondent for Seattle:KidStuff. Aside from standard text messaging rates, the service itself is free. I&#039;d love your honest feedback: good, bad, or indifferent.  


Thanks!
