					<description><![CDATA[Doug and I area also keeping mum about the names on our short list for this same exact reason.

I did have this fleeting thought about what would happen if you two had a boy and chose our #1 boy name. I suppose we&#039;d have 3 months to recover...

For now, we just call him Cleatus the Fetus. 

We told Doug&#039;s mom his name was Cleatus and she flipped out, &quot;Just remember he has to live with that name FOR THE TEST OF HIS LIFE!&quot; Us: &quot;Uh, it&#039;s a JOKE.&quot;]]></description>
