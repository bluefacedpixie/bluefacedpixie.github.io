					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s easy to blow and answer in public speaking, or for impressions to come across too strongly: despite my many comments about Microsoft, Excel is one of the best software apps ever written, so it&#039;s easy to misconstrue.

As far as Apple&#039;s success (or Amazon&#039;s) and this being based on a public or corporate blog as a method of communication I think it&#039;s choice - both Apple and Amazon play the blogging channels in different ways.

And as for a CTO phoning you - that&#039;s what CTO&#039;s do :) (identify useful contacts and have many ways of getting their phone number).

I&#039;m still planning on reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/e/o/asin/047174719X/bluefacedpixi-20&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Naked Conversations&lt;/a&gt; this spring, or summer...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wish I had answered the Apple question better. My son, picture here: http://www.horsepigcow.com/2006/03/brunching.html, is a big Apple fan, so maybe I&#039;m a bit touchy on the topic. They have a great brand and a great company, it&#039;s just that I think that culturally they are going to have troubles long term. Here&#039;s an exercise. What happens if Steve Jobs dies tonight?

Go and watch this video buy Guy Kawasaki. http://news.com.com/1606-2-6055690.html

Even HE says Apple&#039;s success is all due to Steve Jobs. What if Steve left? There&#039;s be massive brand destruction cause of that belief. Whereas at companies like IBM and Sun that blog a lot more, they have a lot more people you can have a business relationship with. 

That leads to better products. Better relationships with influencers, press, customers. And more caught opportunities. 

Last week the CTO of a big company called me with a problem (he couldn&#039;t get his problem taken care of through normal channels). My cell phone is on my blog. He was able to get help quickly and I was able to save a big customer.

Will that show up in our balance sheet this quarter? Probably not. But long term, because there are 2,500 people you can talk with here, you&#039;re more likely to listen to us, and more likely to tell us what&#039;s on your mind. Not to mention that because you blog I can listen to you very effectively too (like I just found you within 30 minutes of you posting).

Is anyone from Apple listening to you? You just mentioned them. I wonder if they&#039;ll ever show up here? I doubt it. I haven&#039;t seen them show up on other blogs.]]></description>
