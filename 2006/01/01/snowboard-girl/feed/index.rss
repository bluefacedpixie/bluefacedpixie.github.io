					<description><![CDATA[[...] As narrated in &#8220;Run Away&#8220;, my Nikon 5700 died after 3 years and I decided to replace it quickly in order to have a camera for our upcoming Mexico vacation. We do have another digital camera: the faithful Konica Minolta Dimage X50. Even though Konica Minolta have recently announced they are exiting the camera business and there is a newer X60 out there I recommend this camera as a point-and-shoot, but as it&#8217;s got a few bashes and occasionally suffers from photo-blur itself it doesn&#8217;t stand up as our main camera. Even though it&#8217;s been doing all of the heavy lifting for the snowboarding and aphotoperday shots this year. [...]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[...] Well G already blogged about my first snowboarding adventure (see the pics here). He took me out to Snoqualmie on Saturday where I repeatedly hurled myself down a hill at great speeds. I fell on my knees, my butt, my head (thank God I had a helmet!) and careened into large snow drifts. For the most part, it was quite fun. I have some odd bruises to show for it and I also managed to end up in what seemed like every hole on the mountain. G found it quite funny when I crashed into a really muddy hole and had to pull my board out of the muck with great effort. [...]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[...] First we went snowboarding, and then went for Indian at the India Bistro. This was great &#8211; we had been outside, energetic, were tired and completely stuffed &#8211; perhaps a new tradition in the making. Then we swung down by the Tractor with our friends Morgan and Kristen and managed to pick up tickets to The Long Winters after all! So we ended up being up for the Bells, although we were pretty tired and bailed after the band played the majority of it&#8217;s main set. As we didn&#8217;t intend to be out we have no photos, but they would probably be too blurry to recognize anyone anyway.
