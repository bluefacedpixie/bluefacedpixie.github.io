					<description><![CDATA[[...] After over three years of pretty faithful service and hundreds of great photos my Nikon 5700  has just freaked out. Although I got it serviced and a few new gears put in last October the digital/focus/CCD part of it seems to have started suddenly to fail. I can&#8217;t remember dropping it, and it was taking good pictures on the 16th. As today&#8217;s Avocado picture shows, all is no longer well in the state of Denmark.  This picture of our dining table also looks quite arty. I was feeling brave though and though maybe something had just got loose so decided to open the camera up. One look was enough:  Wise men run away. I quickly put the beast back together again, although the screws were pretty small. Here&#8217;s half of them:  Not quite sure what I&#8217;m going to do, as the repair cost last October was about 1/3 the price of the whole camera and apparently these things don&#8217;t last forever. Maybe I need to start thinking Digital SLR, especially as my little Dimage X50 (which took the legible pictures) is bashed, occasionally takes similar looking pictures and is falling apart slightly. At least I remember dropping that one &#8211; several times. But I need a camera for a photo per day.   Posted by bfp in Toys, Photos&#160;&#124; Time:&#160;10:06 pm&#160; [...]]]></description>
