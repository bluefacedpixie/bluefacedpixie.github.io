					<description><![CDATA[[...] A side comment on my D50 rather than the retired Coolpix 5700, not a full review: I miss the simple &#8220;black and white&#8221; mode on the 5700. I know that any digital shot can be made BW afterwards (I&#8217;m lo-tech and use iPhoto) but it&#8217;s post-processing work, and I love the convenience of a digital camera enough not to want to have a digital darkroom. And I still harbour the sneaking suspicion that if I&#8217;m not shooting RAW then the 5700 did some sort of &#8216;stuff the extra BW bits into the JPG to make the shot look better&#8217; magic that makes it&#8217;s 5MP BW shots better than a converted 6MP colour JPG.

					<description><![CDATA[[...] As narrated in &#8220;Run Away&#8220;, my Nikon 5700 died after 3 years and I decided to replace it quickly in order to have a camera for our upcoming Mexico vacation. We do have another digital camera: the faithful Konica Minolta Dimage X50. Even though Konica Minolta have recently announced they are exiting the camera business and there is a newer X60 out there I recommend this camera as a point-and-shoot, but as it&#8217;s got a few bashes and occasionally suffers from photo-blur itself it doesn&#8217;t stand up as our main camera. Even though it&#8217;s been doing all of the heavy lifting for the snowboarding and aphotoperday shots this year. [...]]]></description>
