					<description><![CDATA[The Pentax did tempt me - but I think it was the &quot;common man&quot; approach to the Nikon (lots of lenses, articles, fellow users) which swayed me.   The Pentax did not look good on paper but in-hand it was a nice fit, although its menu system seemed a little strange and the demo pictures lacked life.   In terms of menus I still find Konica-Minolta the best, although it looks like the D50 will be straightforward and as confusing as any Digital camera (far less SLR) can be.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, haven&#039;t posted here in a wee while ... Yah, from my limited non-geek knowledge the DSLRs look very excellent value now - I like the D50, but I have a soft spot for Pentax cameras too; my chemical SLR is a Pentax, and results of my snapping have always satisfied. 

Cool camera though, that Nikon :) I wouldn&#039;t say no.]]></description>
