					<description><![CDATA[I like it. Very nice. I&#039;d probably personally burn the sign to make it go completely black, but you could definitely go the other way.

Do you have Photoshop? If so, it&#039;s pretty easy to tweak that section (I also think Photoshop gives you much nicer options for B&#038;W conversion than iPhoto does).]]></description>
